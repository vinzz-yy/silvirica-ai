# Deploy And Monitor

This is a Silvirica-native `deploy-and-monitor` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`deploy-and-monitor` exists to keep `monitoring` work explicit, evidence-backed, and inside the Hermes/executor boundary instead of relying on ad hoc chat narration.

## Do Not Use When

- An incident has already been declared and the work is commanding it -- severity, commander, running timeline, recovery verification -- rather than watching a release; use `live-incident-response`.
- The ask is deciding a release before it ships -- what goes in, its version and tag, the canary stages, or which command rolls it back; use `release-cut`, which writes the rollback trigger down before it is needed.
- The change is to declared infrastructure itself -- a Terraform plan, a Kubernetes manifest, a Helm chart -- and needs its drift, blast radius, and cost delta read before it is applied; use `iac-change`.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: deploy-and-monitor: prepare the release monitor, rollback signals, health checks, and post-deploy status card.
- Expected behavior: Create release monitoring guidance with deployment, metric, rollback, and observation boundaries.
- Why: The request is about deploy readiness and monitoring rather than code review alone.

Bad example:

- Prompt: deploy-and-monitor: treat casual chat or unaccepted work as if this workflow already produced verified results.
- Expected behavior: Ask a clarification question or route to a narrower workflow instead of forcing `deploy-and-monitor`.
- Why: The request lacks the required inputs or would overclaim work that Hermes did not observe.

## Completion Checklist

- Confirm the workflow target, evidence boundary, and stop condition are named.
- Report which outputs are prepared, observed, blocked, or missing.
- Name the smallest next verification or handoff instead of claiming completion from narration.

## Recovery Notes

- If required context is missing, ask one blocking question or route back to the narrower workflow.
- If runtime or wrapper evidence is unavailable, keep the status as not_observed and expose the next observable action.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Coding handoff** (`idea-to-deploy`, `llm-app-dev`, `cto-loop`, `deploy-and-monitor`, `code-review`, `build-failure-triage`, `verification-gate`, `security-safety-review`, `+28 more`) - coding owners, handoffs, review, CI, and merge evidence.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should prepare or narrate a release operation with deploy checklist, health signals, rollback criteria, and post-deploy status without pretending to run infrastructure.

    Strong routing signals: `deploy-and-monitor`, `deploy and monitor`, `deploy monitor`, `deployment monitoring`, `release monitor`, `post deploy`, `post-deploy`, `rollback`, `rollback gate`, `health check`, `incident watch`, `release health`, `deploy this service`, `배포 모니터링`, `서비스 배포`, `프로덕션 배포`, `인프라에 배포`, `배포 감시`, `롤백`, `헬스 체크`, `장애 감시`, `릴리즈 모니터링`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `monitoring`
Phase: `release-ops`
Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `release-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name release scope, target environment, health signals, rollback criteria, and evidence owner.
- Show pre-deploy, deploy decision, monitor, rollback, and post-deploy as distinct stages.
- Mark health and rollback status unknown until observed evidence arrives.

Handoff policy:

Keep release checklist, health criteria, rollback gates, and status narration in Hermes; record deploy, monitor, incident, or rollback evidence only when the wrapper or operator observes it.

Required inputs:

- release scope
- environment
- health signals
- rollback owner

Expected outputs:

- pre-deploy checklist
- deploy decision gate
- monitoring watchlist
- rollback criteria
- post-deploy status boundary

Artifact expectations:

- release operation status record when the wrapper captures deploy or monitor observations
- web_qa_comparison/v1 for a canary only with a trusted host_deployment_observation/v1 and a production baseline captured before it

Artifact contracts:

This label denotes the machine-enforcement level, not a skill quality score and not an observed evidence state.

- contract_id: `deploy-and-monitor`; enforcement_level: `guidance_only`; consumer_id: `none`

Safety rules:

- Do not claim deployment, health checks, rollback, or incident response happened from a prepared checklist.
- Keep release readiness, deploy decision, monitor signals, and rollback as separate evidence steps.
- Route code fixes discovered during monitoring as later executor handoffs.
- A canary web-QA comparison never authorizes rollback; a missing deployment observation is BLOCK and a field regression beyond tolerance is REVISE.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `app-delivery-loop`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill deploy-and-monitor --harness app-delivery-loop --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- When wrapper metadata includes `memory_review_card/v1` or `handoff_context_pack/v1`, treat it as reviewed Silvirica-local or wrapper-supplied context only. Use conflict-free context summaries to shape plans and handoffs, but do not claim Hermes internal memory was read or changed.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
