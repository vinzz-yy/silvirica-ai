# Github Event Ops

This is a Silvirica-native `github-event-ops` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`github-event-ops` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.
- The event is a security advisory, a CVE in a dependency, or a leaked credential; use `security-event-response`, which orders containment and closes only on an observed rotation or fix.
- The PR is a dependabot or renovate version bump with no advisory; use `refactor-plan`, which decides whether it is safe to merge from the breaking changes against this repository's call sites.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: github-event-ops PR opened with failing CI; triage whether this needs review or fix handoff.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_github_event_ops_card` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: github-event-ops prove the issue was labelled and CI was rerun.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Confirm the workflow target, evidence boundary, and stop condition are named.
- Report which outputs are prepared, observed, blocked, or missing.
- Name the smallest next verification or handoff instead of claiming completion from narration.

## Recovery Notes

- If required context is missing, ask one blocking question or route back to the narrower workflow.
- If runtime or wrapper evidence is unavailable, keep the status as not_observed and expose the next observable action.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when Hermes receives or is asked to reason about GitHub PR, issue, review, or CI events and must choose review, triage, or fix-handoff without claiming a bot ran.

    Strong routing signals: `github-event-ops`, `github event ops`, `github ops`, `github triage`, `github pr`, `github review`, `github action`, `github actions`, `pr opened`, `pull request opened`, `pull request review`, `pr review`, `ci failed`, `check failed`, `checks failed`, `failing checks`, `issue opened`, `issue triage`, `pull request webhook`, `github webhook`, `github issue`, `github issue to pr`, `auto review pr`, `label issue`, `label pr`, `ci analysis`, `fix handoff`, `review handoff`, `깃허브`, `깃허브 pr`, `깃허브 이슈`, `github issue 들어온`, `이슈 라벨`, `pr 리뷰`, `리뷰 라벨`, `픽스 핸드오프`, `ci 실패`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `github-ops`
Phase: `event-routing`
Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- github-event-ops/v1 card or guidance
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- github-event-ops/v1 metadata-only runtime or wrapper card when recorded

Safety rules:

- A GitHub event ops card is not webhook delivery, GitHub API mutation, review completion, label application, CI rerun, or fix execution evidence. When a fix is owned by Hermes coding, read `hermes_coding_harness/v1` before reporting build, review, CI, PR, or merge state.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `github-event-ops`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill github-event-ops --harness github-event-ops --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
