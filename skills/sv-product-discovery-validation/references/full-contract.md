# Product Discovery Validation

Load this on-demand contract after the compact `product-discovery-validation` body identifies the
workflow. The main body owns routing signals, shared rules, the runtime
operation, delegation fallback, and completion/recovery pointers; this file
holds the workflow-specific detail without copying those shared rails.

## Why This Exists

`product-discovery-validation` gives an early idea a bounded, evidence-typed path to a kill, pivot, persevere, or inconclusive decision so `product-brief` consumes validated inputs instead of judging raw discovery itself.

## Do Not Use When

- The user needs market, competitor, pricing, or customer research on named sources without a discovery decision to make; use `research-brief`.
- The user is clarifying their own request, requirements, or preferences rather than testing a customer problem with external people; use `deep-interview`.
- The user needs a company or product strategy decision across existing options with evidence already in hand; use `strategy-brief`.
- The problem, segment, and evidence are already validated and accepted and the user wants a PRD or prioritization; use `product-brief`.
- An accepted product brief and plan exist and the user wants implementation, QA, and release gates; use `idea-to-deploy`.
- The user has one falsifiable technical or empirical question a disposable prototype can answer; use `decision-prototype`.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: I think freelance designers struggle to chase late invoices. Before we write a PRD, help me test whether this is worth building.
- Expected behavior: Frame the decision and kill criteria, classify the existing evidence, plan past-behavior customer interviews, rank the riskiest assumptions with precommitted tests, and stop at an explicit kill, pivot, persevere, or inconclusive receipt.
- Why: The request is a pre-PRD discovery decision about a customer problem and segment, not research on named sources, requester clarification, or a PRD.

Bad example:

- Prompt: Write the PRD for our invoice-chasing feature; the interviews already confirmed the problem.
- Expected behavior: Route to `product-brief` and ask for the accepted discovery receipt or evidence rather than rerunning discovery.
- Why: Validated, accepted evidence with a PRD request belongs to the PRD owner, not to discovery.

## Completion Checklist

- The problem gate state is recorded as validated, refuted, or inconclusive with the external-human or behavioral-data refs that decided it, all observed in the framed target segment.
- The target segment is explicit enough to recruit or tied to observed behavioral data before any solution, PRD, prototype, or coding output leaves this workflow.
- Every assumption test in the portfolio carries its precommitted success, failure, inconclusive, segment, deadline, cost, owner, and evidence re-entry fields.
- The receipt names kill, pivot, persevere, or inconclusive, preserves rejected paths, and routes to `product-brief` only from an accepted persevere.
- Every artifact is reported as prepared; interviews, tests, and prototypes stay not_observed until re-entered evidence exists.

## Recovery Notes

- If external-human or behavioral-data evidence is absent, hold the problem gate at inconclusive and hand the customer discovery plan to a human owner instead of filling the gap with personas.
- If a test passes its deadline or budget without meeting a precommitted condition, record inconclusive with the residual risk and let the decision owner choose a new budget or a kill.
- If the target segment is unknown, synthetic-only, or non-recruitable, keep the discovery frame and customer discovery plan and report defining a recruitable or behaviorally observed audience as the next evidence task.
- If a pivot changes the problem or segment, open a new decision frame and carry the falsified hypotheses forward as rejected paths.

## Use When

Use when a founder or product owner brings an early idea and needs the problem, segment, value proposition, and business hypothesis framed, evidence-typed, and tested to an explicit discovery decision before a PRD, prototype, or delivery plan exists.

## Workflow Contract

Category: `planning`
Phase: `product-discovery-validation`
Hermes role: `planner`
Quality tier: `decision-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Separate the decision frame, typed evidence, customer re-entry plan, ranked assumptions, and the receipt so each can be reviewed alone.
- Keep every kill, pivot, persevere, or inconclusive claim tied to precommitted criteria and observed evidence.

Handoff policy:

Keep decision framing, evidence classification, assumption ranking, test precommitment, and the discovery decision in Hermes. A prepared plan, ledger, portfolio, or receipt is not participant recruitment, an interview, a survey, a payment, a prototype, a PRD, code, or a launch. Prepare a `product-brief` handoff only from a `persevere` receipt the decision owner accepted; route a single empirical prototype question to `decision-prototype`; reach `idea-to-deploy` only after the resulting product brief and plan are accepted.

Required inputs:

- problem hypothesis
- target segment
- known evidence and current alternatives
- decision owner
- learning budget and deadline
- success, failure, and stop criteria

Expected outputs:

- discovery_decision_frame/v1
- discovery_evidence_ledger/v1
- customer_discovery_plan/v1
- assumption_test_portfolio/v1
- discovery_decision_receipt/v1
- initial_gtm_hypothesis/v1

Artifact expectations:

- prepared discovery decision frame, evidence ledger, customer discovery plan, assumption test portfolio, decision receipt, and GTM hypothesis when a wrapper captures them

Safety rules:

- Do not recruit or contact participants, record interviews, run surveys, scrape communities, buy ads, launch fake doors, accept payments, build a prototype, write a PRD, write code, or deploy anything from this workflow.
- Synthetic personas, model-generated interview answers, secondary summaries, prototypes without representative-user observation, and unsupported market-size figures cannot satisfy a customer-validation gate.
- Interview praise, stated purchase intent, a waitlist signup, a finished prototype, or one passed experiment is not product-market fit; state what each signal can and cannot establish.
- Founder-market fit and strategic preference may inform the decision but never substitute for target-customer evidence.
- An unknown, synthetic-only, or non-recruitable target segment blocks a solution, PRD, prototype-as-validation, or coding handoff; discovery framing, the customer discovery plan, and evidence work continue while it does.
