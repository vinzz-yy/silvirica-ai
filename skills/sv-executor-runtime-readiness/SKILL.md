# Executor Runtime Readiness

This is a Silvirica-native `executor-runtime-readiness` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`executor-runtime-readiness` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: executor-runtime-readiness can this task run in Codex, Claude Code, or Hermes coding?
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_executor_runtime_readiness` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: executor-runtime-readiness claim Codex already started the session.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- The selected coding or runtime owner is named before any implementation claim.
- Prepared handoff, dispatch, execution, verification, review, CI, and merge states are separated.
- The final status cites observed runtime evidence or keeps the work prepared_not_observed.
- When Hermes is the selected coding owner, use `hermes_coding_harness/v1` to keep builder, verifier, reviewer, docs, and PR lanes separate.
- Report the current harness stage, owner, next action, and missing evidence without claiming PR creation, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge until matching runtime observations exist.

## Recovery Notes

- If the selected executor is unavailable, ask for Codex, Claude Code, Hermes, or another runtime before retrying.
- If dispatch or result evidence is missing, keep the handoff prepared_not_observed and expose the next observable action.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Coding handoff** (`idea-to-deploy`, `llm-app-dev`, `cto-loop`, `deploy-and-monitor`, `code-review`, `build-failure-triage`, `verification-gate`, `security-safety-review`, `+28 more`) - coding owners, handoffs, review, CI, and merge evidence.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when a user may choose Codex, Claude Code, Hermes coding, or another runtime and needs tool/credential gaps before handoff.

    Strong routing signals: `executor-runtime-readiness`, `executor readiness`, `runtime readiness`, `codex readiness`, `claude code readiness`, `hermes coding readiness`, `executor tools`, `missing tools`, `missing runtime tools`, `runtime tools`, `coding agent readiness`, `coding runtime`, `handoff mode`, `handoff readiness`, `codex or claude`, `codex vs claude`, `codex tools`, `claude code tools`, `hermes coding`, `agent runtime`, `subagent readiness`, `worktree readiness`, `runtime migration`, `omx`, `omc`, `omo`, `codex로 넘길지 claude`, `claude code로 넘길지 codex`, `codex랑 claude`, `claude code 중`, `넘길지 codex`, `넘길지 claude`, `코덱스`, `클로드 코드`, `헤르메스 코딩`, `코딩 에이전트`, `서브에이전트`, `작업트리`, `준비성`, `실행 런타임`, `어떤 런타임`, `런타임으로 넘겨`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `executor-readiness`
Phase: `runtime-selection`
Hermes role: `handoff-guide`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Executor readiness:

- When accepted work mutates code, check `executor_readiness/v1` for the selected Codex, Claude Code, Hermes, or oh-my runtime path before first dispatch.
- If readiness is `missing` or `blocked`, ask the user to choose another coding agent, configure PATH, continue in Hermes, or keep a prompt/runtime handoff; retry only after that state changes.
- A readiness probe is not dispatch, implementation, verification, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.

Delegation transparency:

- When delegating, show the composed delegate prompt in a fenced code block in the status message; truncate a long prompt to a bounded preview ending with `... [truncated, N chars total]` — the user must see WHAT was asked, not just that something was.
- Name every delegated or parallel lane's model and, when the host exposes it, its reasoning effort inline as `(model effort)` in status and briefing lines — including runtime-native subagents; when no effort is exposed, show the model alone as `(model)` rather than writing a placeholder like `unknown` beside a known model, and never emit empty parentheses. Carry token and elapsed figures the same way in these narration lines: report observed figures and omit unobserved ones — when the user asks for a figure directly, say it was not observed instead of omitting it; a rendered status-board column keeps its own `unknown` cell.
- Capture a resumable session or thread id at dispatch and report it in the status message: for non-interactive Claude Code pass `--output-format json` and read `session_id` from the result (resume with `claude -p --resume <session-id>`); for Codex pass `--json` and read `thread_id` (resume with `codex exec resume <thread-id>`, repeating `--skip-git-repo-check` outside a git repo). Never leave a delegate run with no recorded way to resume or steer it — a plain-text one-shot that hides its session id strands the work when the run stalls or times out.
- Before dispatch, grant the executor session every permission the task will need — file write/edit, command/test execution, and the working directory — on the dispatch command itself, not through settings-file guesses: for non-interactive Claude Code pass `--permission-mode acceptEdits` or an explicit `--allowedTools` list (`--dangerously-skip-permissions` only inside an isolated worktree or sandbox), and the equivalent sandbox/approval flags for other CLIs. `acceptEdits: true` is not a settings key and `~/.claude/settings.local.json` is not a file Claude Code reads — user scope is `~/.claude/settings.json` and project scope is `<dispatch cwd>/.claude/settings.local.json` with rules under `permissions.allow`. Prove the grant with a bounded scratch-edit probe run before the real dispatch: a permission denial in a non-interactive run recurs identically on retry, so never redispatch until a changed grant is proven, and surface an ungrantable permission as a blocker before dispatch, not after minutes of silence.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- executor-runtime-readiness/v1 card or guidance
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- executor-runtime-readiness/v1 metadata-only runtime or wrapper card when recorded

Safety rules:

- Runtime readiness is not executor dispatch, plugin load, tool invocation, repository mutation, review, CI, or merge evidence.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `executor-runtime-readiness`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill executor-runtime-readiness --harness executor-runtime-readiness --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
