# Skill Scout

This is a Silvirica-native `skill-scout` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`skill-scout` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: skill-scout find existing skill candidates before we create a release-note workflow skill.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_skill_scout` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: skill-scout install the best GitHub skill and copy it into the marketplace without review.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Intent, keywords, source scope, and stop condition are explicit.
- Local and external search evidence is separated from planned search.
- No install, copy, write, credential, or trust claim is made without observed review or implementation.

## Recovery Notes

- If the request is about setup or installed skill repair, route to doctor.
- If the request is a portfolio health dashboard, route to skill-health.
- If the request is an approved skill mutation or creation task, route to skill or implementation after the scout decision.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use before creating or adapting a skill so Silvirica can compare existing local, marketplace, GitHub, or web candidates without installing, copying, or trusting them by default.

Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- skill_scout_query/v1
- local_skill_candidate_inventory/v1 when observed
- external_skill_candidate_risk_review/v1 when observed
- awesome_hermes_agent_coverage/v1 for upstream ecosystem comparison when requested
- skill_adoption_decision_matrix/v1
- skill_scout_recommendation/v1

Artifact expectations:

- skill_scout_query/v1 with intended workflow, triggers, domains/tools, and search keywords
- local_skill_candidate_inventory/v1 separating installed, bundled, marketplace, and repo-local matches when observed
- awesome_hermes_agent_coverage/v1 mapping upstream ecosystem entries to Silvirica covered, partial, or missing_candidate coverage statuses, matched Silvirica surfaces, rule_set_version, and matched_rule_id
- skill_adoption_decision_matrix/v1 ranking use existing, fork or extend, and create fresh options with trust gaps

Safety rules:

- A skill scout report is not skill installation, external source trust, marketplace mutation, file copy, network retrieval, credential use, implementation, review, CI, or proof that a candidate is safe to adopt.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `skill-scout`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill skill-scout --harness skill-scout --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
