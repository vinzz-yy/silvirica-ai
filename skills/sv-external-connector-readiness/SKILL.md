# External Connector Readiness

This is a Silvirica-native `external-connector-readiness` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`external-connector-readiness` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: external-connector-readiness compare weather plugin and wxtrain candidates with cost, freshness, multimodal evidence, and fallback routes before adoption.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_external_connector_readiness` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: external-connector-readiness silently enable a paid connector and claim weather, SQL, and screenshot results without observed provider evidence.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Candidate connector, target domain, read/write scope, modality needs, provider owner, fallback workflow, and stop condition are explicit.
- Cost, quota, credential, permission, live-data freshness, multimodal capture, safety, and compliance boundaries are marked ready, missing, risky, or not_observed.
- Route live read-only lookups to live-info-operator, external writes to connector-operator, datasets/SQL to data-analysis, and missing tools to toolbelt-readiness before claiming results.
- Provider responses, screenshots, audio/video/file captures, query outputs, message ids, and external mutations are reported only from observed trial evidence.
- For a memory provider, disabling it, removing its local cache, deleting its remote memory, deleting the account, and switching away are reported as distinct operations with distinct postconditions.
- Unknown deletion, isolation, or write semantics block automatic writes and irreversible adoption instead of resolving to an Silvirica or Hermes default.
- For a realtime voice connector, keep turn integrity, latency, fallback, interruption, and spoken tool safety separate; report unsupported or unobserved dimensions as hold or block rather than as a pass.

## Recovery Notes

- If the candidate list is unknown, route to skill-scout or source-finder before readiness scoring.
- If credentials, cost authority, or connector installation is missing, keep readiness blocked and route setup to toolbelt-readiness.
- If a specific provider action is already selected, route read-only live data to live-info-operator or write/mutation tasks to connector-operator.
- If a memory-provider lifecycle field is unknown, ask the operator to declare it or supply an observed trial receipt; hand the result to memory-sync as not_omh_reviewed context rather than importing it into Silvirica review.
- If a realtime voice connector has no supplied realtime_voice_trial_receipt/v1, route the setup and the trial run to the host, connector, or operator that owns the microphone, call, or room, then consume only the returned receipt.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.

## Use When

Use before adopting, enabling, or routing an external plugin/connector/API when Hermes must compare capability, auth, cost, modality, freshness, safety, fallback, and observable trial evidence. Use it for an optional memory provider too, where enabling, switching, pausing, or removing it also needs identity scope, automatic hooks, retention, deletion, export, and switching answered before adoption.

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `connector`
Phase: `connector-readiness`
Hermes role: `guide`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.
- Trial two or more memory providers on one corpus and one query set, never on each provider's own sample — load `references/memory-provider-trial.md` for the corpus, query, and reversibility rules.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- external_connector_readiness_card/v1
- connector_capability_matrix/v1
- auth_cost_boundary/v1
- live_data_freshness_policy/v1 when live data is required
- multimodal_routing_policy/v1 when screenshots, audio, video, or files are involved
- fallback_route_policy/v1
- connector_trial_manifest/v1 when observed
- memory_provider_posture/v1 when the candidate is an optional memory provider
- memory_provider_trial_comparison/v1 when two or more memory providers are trialled on one corpus
- realtime_voice_trial_receipt/v1 when a supplied realtime voice trial is observed
- realtime_voice_readiness/v1 verdict per voice dimension when a receipt is supplied
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- external_connector_readiness_card/v1 metadata-only wrapper card when prepared
- connector_capability_matrix/v1 with candidate, domain, read/write shape, modality, owner workflow, and fallback route
- auth_cost_boundary/v1 separating missing connector, missing credentials, paid/provider cost risk, quota, and user authority
- live_data_freshness_policy/v1 for requested recency, provider timestamp, stale-result handling, and source-quality thresholds
- multimodal_routing_policy/v1 for screenshot, audio, video, file, OCR, or visual QA evidence routes when needed
- connector_trial_manifest/v1 only when a provider response, capture id, query transcript, message id, or tool-call observation is recorded
- memory_provider_posture/v1 for an optional memory provider, covering identity scope, automatic hooks, storage boundary, synchronization, failure, retention, deletion, export/import, backup/restore, and portability, each marked ready, missing, risky, not_observed, or unknown
- memory_provider_trial_comparison/v1 built on the connector_trial_manifest/v1 pattern: one corpus and one query set per candidate, retrieval quality, latency, and cost each reported per provider or marked not_observed, plus the migration route and the rollback that was exercised rather than asserted
- realtime_voice_trial_receipt/v1 only when an authorized host, connector, or operator supplies the observed trial: connector build identity, requested versus observed stack, per-turn milestones on one declared timing reference, turn-integrity states, fallback path, interruption behavior, and spoken tool decisions
- realtime_voice_readiness/v1 with a pass, hold, or block state and reasons for turn integrity, latency, fallback, interruption, and tool safety, plus the separated connector-configured, synthetic-trial, actual-environment-trial, voice-turn, tool-action, and session-completed states

Safety rules:

- An external connector readiness card is not connector installation, credential validation, provider access, API invocation, multimodal capture, live-data retrieval, external mutation, cost authorization, or successful trial evidence unless observed connector-trial evidence records it.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.
- A hook registration or lifecycle callback is an observation point only; it never grants write or synchronization authority.
- Documentation and open package code declare a contract; neither establishes a hosted service's storage, retention, cost, or deletion postcondition.
- A memory provider stays optional: an unknown or unavailable provider never becomes a required default and never makes Silvirica memory unusable.
- A realtime voice verdict comes only from a supplied realtime_voice_trial_receipt/v1. Silvirica opens no microphone, call, room, socket, or provider session, installs no connector, downloads no voice model, and authorizes no tool from a receipt.
- A synthetic voice fixture never proves the intended room, microphone, network, or telephony path, and a fallback path succeeding is never success for the requested voice stack, provider, or model.
- Generic connector, voice-input, and media-input records are not realtime voice readiness; a turn that lost its onset, split, merged, dispatched twice, truncated, or replayed after audible output blocks the verdict rather than reporting latency.
- A memory-provider trial reports retrieval quality, latency, and cost per candidate only from host-supplied observation; a dimension nobody measured is not_observed, never a default or a zero, and a corpus is never copied into the record.
- A rollback is proven by exercising it during the trial and recording what came back; a documented rollback path is prepared, not reversible.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `external-connector-readiness`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill external-connector-readiness --harness external-connector-readiness --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
