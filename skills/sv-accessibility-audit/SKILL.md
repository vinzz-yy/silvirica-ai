# Accessibility Audit

This is a Silvirica-native `accessibility-audit` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`accessibility-audit` adapts ECC's accessibility-architect posture into an Silvirica-native workflow so frontend quality includes WCAG, keyboard, screen-reader, pointer, contrast, and reflow gates without pretending a plan is observed compliance.

## Do Not Use When

- The user needs initial frontend design or redesign planning before accessibility-specific review; use `frontend` first.
- The user needs rendered layout, screenshot, CJK, or pixel-diff QA rather than accessibility semantics; use `visual-qa`.
- The user needs a broad premium-quality gate across web, deck, PDF, or posters; use `design-quality-gate`.
- The user asks to implement accessibility fixes directly; prepare a selected executor/runtime handoff after the audit or use the coding workflow.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: accessibility-audit 이 checkout flow가 WCAG 2.2 AA, 키보드 포커스, 스크린리더, 터치 타깃 기준으로 통과 가능한지 봐줘.
- Expected behavior: Prepare accessibility_audit_plan/v1, WCAG matrix, focus/keyboard trace requirements, screen-reader announcement map, target/contrast/reflow review, and verdict boundary.
- Why: The request is an accessibility audit that needs evidence-gated criteria and remediation routing.

Bad example:

- Prompt: accessibility-audit 스크린리더나 키보드 확인 없이 접근성 통과라고 말해줘.
- Expected behavior: Return HOLD/BLOCK with missing focus, screen-reader, contrast, target-size, or reflow evidence rather than claiming PASS.
- Why: A prepared accessibility plan is not observed WCAG or assistive-technology evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- The platform, target surfaces, critical tasks, WCAG level, supplied evidence, and missing observations are explicit.
- The wcag_success_criteria_matrix/v1 separates PASS/HOLD/BLOCK and maps each issue to user impact.
- Semantic structure, focus/keyboard, screen-reader announcements, target size/pointer, contrast/reflow, and form/status behavior are separate checks.
- PASS is unavailable unless evidence is fresh after the latest UI edit and covers critical tasks.
- Remediation, frontend implementation, visual QA, browser proof, CI, release, and merge remain separate observed states.

## Recovery Notes

- If no rendered or DOM/accessibility-tree evidence exists, prepare the audit plan and mark verdict BLOCKED_BY_MISSING_ACCESSIBILITY_EVIDENCE.
- If automated scan output exists without keyboard or screen-reader evidence, keep the verdict HOLD and request the smallest focus/announcement trace.
- If the request is mostly visual layout or CJK clipping, route to visual-qa while preserving accessibility follow-up checks.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Materials and visual summaries** (`design-orchestration`, `apple-design`, `design-quality-gate`, `award-bar-score`, `frontend`, `accessibility-audit`, `visual-qa`, `content-operator`, `+6 more`) - web, accessibility, visual QA, files, and packages.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when Hermes must audit a UI or design system for WCAG 2.2 AA, keyboard reachability, focus flow, screen-reader semantics, target size, contrast, reflow, and accessibility evidence before claiming pass.

    Strong routing signals: `accessibility-audit`, `accessibility audit`, `a11y audit`, `a11y architect`, `wcag audit`, `wcag 2.2`, `wcag 2.2 aa`, `accessibility pass`, `accessibility check`, `screen reader`, `screenreader`, `aria audit`, `keyboard navigation`, `focus order`, `focus appearance`, `focus trap`, `tab order`, `touch target`, `target size`, `color contrast`, `contrast ratio`, `reflow`, `400% zoom`, `accessible name`, `name role value`, `aria`, `アクセシビリティ監査`, `アクセシビリティ確認`, `スクリーンリーダー`, `キーボード操作`, `フォーカス順序`, `タッチターゲット`, `접근성 감사`, `접근성 검토`, `접근성 검사`, `스크린리더`, `키보드 내비게이션`, `포커스 순서`, `포커스 표시`, `터치 타깃`, `타깃 크기`, `색 대비`, `명도 대비`, `无障碍审查`, `无障碍检查`, `屏幕阅读器`, `键盘导航`, `焦点顺序`, `触控目标`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `accessibility`
Phase: `accessibility-audit`
Hermes role: `reviewer`
Quality tier: `accessibility-audit-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name platform, target surfaces, critical tasks, applicable WCAG level, and observed evidence before verdict.
- Map findings to concrete WCAG 2.2 criteria and user impact instead of generic accessibility advice.
- Separate semantic structure, focus/keyboard, screen-reader announcement, target-size/pointer, contrast/reflow, forms/errors, and dynamic status checks.
- Require observed keyboard and assistive-tech or accessibility-tree evidence before PASS.
- Give every finding a stable rule ID from `Silvirica-accessibility-audit/references/a11y-rules.md` - category prefix plus number - beside its WCAG criterion and severity, so two audits of the same surface produce comparable findings and a rerun can say which are resolved, carried, or new.
- Partition each fix by whether the markup determines the answer: `auto` when the correct output follows from the structure itself, `manual` whenever it requires knowing what the content means. A meaning-dependent fix marked `auto` is a defect - it produces confident, wrong alternative text - and a fix that is only half structural is split, never rounded to either side.
- Read the surface fully and collect every finding before reporting one; report rule ID, severity, location, WCAG criterion, fix class, and the fix, so the `auto` rows can be handed to an executor as a batch while the `manual` rows go back carrying the question each one needs answered.
- Route design-system or implementation changes back to frontend or the selected coding owner, then recheck with visual-qa/accessibility evidence.

Handoff policy:

Keep accessibility scope, WCAG mapping, focus-flow expectations, screen-reader semantics, and remediation routing in Hermes. Automated scans, browser keyboard walks, screen-reader observations, contrast measurements, and code fixes require observed wrapper, executor, or user evidence.

Required inputs:

- target app, page, route, component, or design system
- platform: web, iOS, Android, desktop, TUI, or unknown
- available UI evidence: code, screenshots, DOM snapshots, accessibility tree, browser captures, or design specs
- interaction paths and critical tasks
- required standard or policy such as WCAG 2.2 AA
- known risk areas: keyboard traps, missing labels, low contrast, small targets, reflow, live regions, or CJK/localization
- observed accessibility evidence for PASS claims

Expected outputs:

- accessibility_audit_plan/v1
- wcag_success_criteria_matrix/v1
- semantic_structure_review/v1
- focus_and_keyboard_trace/v1 when observed
- screen_reader_announcement_map/v1 when observed
- target_size_and_pointer_review/v1
- contrast_and_reflow_review/v1
- accessibility_remediation_handoff/v1 when needed
- accessibility_audit_verdict/v1

Artifact expectations:

- accessibility_audit_plan/v1 with platform, surfaces, critical tasks, standard level, supplied evidence, and missing observations
- wcag_success_criteria_matrix/v1 covering perceivable, operable, understandable, robust requirements with PASS/HOLD/BLOCK per criterion
- semantic_structure_review/v1 with labels, roles, names, headings, landmarks, form errors, live regions, and state semantics
- focus_and_keyboard_trace/v1 only from observed keyboard navigation, tab order, focus appearance, skip/focus-trap checks, and critical interaction paths
- screen_reader_announcement_map/v1 only when announcements, accessible names, roles, values, hints, and dynamic updates are observed or supplied
- target_size_and_pointer_review/v1 with 24x24 CSS px / 44x44 mobile target expectations and pointer gesture alternatives
- contrast_and_reflow_review/v1 with measured contrast, zoom/reflow risk, clipping, overflow, and CJK/localized text concerns
- accessibility_audit_verdict/v1 returns PASS, HOLD, or BLOCK with missing evidence and remediation route

Safety rules:

- Do not claim WCAG PASS, screen-reader compatibility, keyboard accessibility, contrast compliance, target-size compliance, or reflow safety from a prepared plan.
- Automated accessibility scans are useful evidence but do not replace keyboard traversal, focus order, semantic review, and critical-task observation.
- Do not treat visual QA screenshots, source review, or old captures as current accessibility evidence after UI changes.
- Keep accessibility audit, remediation implementation, browser proof, visual QA, Lighthouse, CI, release, and merge evidence separate.
- A fix class is a property of the fix, never evidence it was applied: an `auto` row is an executor handoff, and the verdict still needs observed evidence gathered after the change.
- For destructive or credentialed flows, require staging-safe or read-only paths before browser/accessibility walks.
- Do not call external scanners, browsers, screen readers, LLMs, or platform services from Silvirica core.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `accessibility-audit`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill accessibility-audit --harness accessibility-audit --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
