# Deliverable Package

This is a Silvirica-native `deliverable-package` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`deliverable-package` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: deliverable-package turn this research into PPT and PDF with attachment status.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_deliverable_package` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: deliverable-package claim the PDF was attached without observed file evidence.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- The deliverable type, audience, source inputs, QA ladder, and delivery boundary are named.
- Prepared generation, generated file, render QA, approval, attachment, and delivery are separate states.
- The next action says whether to generate, revise, QA, approve, attach, or deliver.

## Recovery Notes

- If generation tooling is missing, prepare a prompt or package handoff and mark file output not_observed.
- If QA or attachment evidence is missing, keep generated/delivered states separate and show the next check.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Materials and visual summaries** (`design-orchestration`, `apple-design`, `design-quality-gate`, `award-bar-score`, `frontend`, `accessibility-audit`, `visual-qa`, `content-operator`, `+6 more`) - web, accessibility, visual QA, files, and packages.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should prepare, request generation, QA, and report attachment status for user-visible file deliverables.

    Strong routing signals: `deliverable-package`, `deliverable mode`, `file attachment`, `attach file`, `attachment status`, `file delivery`, `file deliverable status`, `generated file`, `첨부`, `첨부 상태`, `전달 상태`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `deliverables`
Phase: `package-status`
Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- deliverable-package/v1 card or guidance
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- deliverable-package/v1 metadata-only runtime or wrapper card when recorded

Safety rules:

- A deliverable package card is not binary generation, render QA, formula recalculation, approval, upload, attachment, or delivery evidence.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `deliverable-package`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill deliverable-package --harness deliverable-package --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
