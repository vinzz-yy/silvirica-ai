# Command Operator

This is a Silvirica-native `command-operator` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`command-operator` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: command-operator run npm test in the project terminal and summarize the output.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_command_operator_card` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: command-operator run rm -rf without cwd, confirmation, or observation gates.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Command text, working directory, environment assumptions, timeout, safety level, and stop condition are explicit.
- Destructive, credential, network, filesystem mutation, install, deploy, and production commands are gated or marked missing.
- Exit codes, stdout/stderr, test results, package-manager effects, and filesystem mutations are reported only from observed command evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If command text or working directory is missing, ask for the smallest missing scope needed before preparing the command task.
- If the command is destructive, credentialed, networked, install/deploy-oriented, or production-affecting, require an explicit confirmation gate.
- If the user supplied failed command output and asks for root cause, route to build-failure-triage or agent-debug instead of preparing a fresh command.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should prepare or supervise terminal/CLI command execution without claiming the command ran or succeeded.

    Strong routing signals: `command-operator`, `command operator`, `terminal command`, `terminal task`, `shell command`, `shell task`, `cli command`, `command execution`, `run command`, `run this command`, `execute command`, `execute this command`, `run npm test`, `run tests`, `npm test`, `pnpm test`, `bun test`, `uv run`, `python -m unittest`, `pytest`, `make test`, `cargo test`, `go test`, `summarize command output`, `터미널 명령`, `터미널에서`, `셸 명령`, `쉘 명령`, `명령 실행`, `명령어 실행`, `실행 준비`, `npm test 실행`, `테스트 실행`, `결과 요약`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.
- Choose the wait strategy before starting long-running work and bind it to a completion signal the host exposes, never to a status loop: a command that fits one tool call runs once in the foreground with a duration-sized timeout; a longer terminal command runs in the background with completion notification armed and no process-status polling; a delegated lane relies on its delivered result while the parent continues independent work or ends the turn; a CI, PR, deploy, file, port, log-line, or external-session condition uses the host's monitor when observed, else exactly ONE bounded watcher or adaptive backoff outside model turns. Record the handle and observation mode at dispatch; every armed wait needs a hard deadline, a cancellation path, and a fallback naming the missing capability. Each wait closes in one terminal state with bounded evidence; an unbounded idle or busy-wait is a defect and a lost notification times out. One decision-changing midpoint peek and any user-requested status check stay allowed; neither is the wait mechanism. Ladder and terminal states: shared rail.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- command_task_card/v1
- command_scope/v1
- command_safety_gate/v1
- command_result_manifest/v1 when observed
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- command_task_card/v1 metadata-only wrapper card when prepared
- command_scope/v1 with command text, working directory, environment assumptions, timeout, and stop condition
- command_safety_gate/v1 separating read-only, write/mutation, network, credential, and destructive-risk commands
- command_result_manifest/v1 only when exit code, stdout/stderr, logs, or terminal transcript are observed

Safety rules:

- A command operator card is not terminal launch, shell execution, package-manager action, test run, stdout/stderr capture, exit-code success, filesystem mutation, network access, or destructive command evidence unless observed command-result evidence records it.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `command-operator`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill command-operator --harness command-operator --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.
