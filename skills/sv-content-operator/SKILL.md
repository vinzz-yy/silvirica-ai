# Content Operator

This is a Silvirica-native `content-operator` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`content-operator` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: content-operator draft publish-ready release notes with audience, tone, source scope, review gates, and hallucination checks.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_content_operator_card` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: content-operator invent missing facts and claim the customer announcement was sent.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Audience, channel, language, tone, style guide, length, source scope, fact-risk, review owner, and stop condition are explicit.
- Missing facts, source gaps, claims needing citations, legal/compliance needs, approval, publish/send authority, and file-export needs are gated or marked missing.
- Published, sent, exported, approved, and fact-verified claims are reported only from observed evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If the request asks for citations, current facts, or source-backed evidence gathering, route to research or source-finder before drafting.
- If the request asks to send, post, invite, ticket, or mutate an external app, route to connector-operator before claiming delivery.
- If the request asks for PDF, PPT, DOCX, HWP, spreadsheet, or attachment packaging, route to materials-package or deliverable-package.
- If the request is a simple one-off sentence or paragraph transformation, answer directly instead of opening a workflow.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Materials and visual summaries** (`design-orchestration`, `apple-design`, `design-quality-gate`, `award-bar-score`, `frontend`, `accessibility-audit`, `visual-qa`, `content-operator`, `+6 more`) - web, accessibility, visual QA, files, and packages.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should prepare or supervise quality-controlled content creation or transformation without claiming source access, fact verification, stakeholder approval, publishing, sending, file export, or delivery.

    Strong routing signals: `content-operator`, `content operator`, `content workflow`, `writing workflow`, `publish-ready writing`, `publish ready writing`, `release notes`, `release note draft`, `newsletter draft`, `customer announcement`, `customer copy`, `product copy`, `landing page copy`, `social post draft`, `email draft`, `draft an email`, `rewrite for executives`, `summarize for customers`, `style guide rewrite`, `audience and tone`, `tone of voice`, `콘텐츠 오퍼레이터`, `글쓰기 워크플로`, `릴리즈 노트`, `릴리즈노트`, `뉴스레터 초안`, `고객 공지문`, `고객 공지`, `고객용 요약`, `메일 초안`, `이메일 초안`, `채널별 톤`, `문체 가이드`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `content`
Phase: `content-task`
Hermes role: `guide`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- content_task_card/v1
- source_scope/v1
- audience_tone_style/v1
- content_review_gate/v1
- content_output_manifest/v1 when observed
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- content_task_card/v1 metadata-only wrapper card when prepared
- source_scope/v1 with supplied sources, missing sources, fact-risk, citation need, and no-invention rule
- audience_tone_style/v1 with audience, channel, language, tone, style guide, length, format, and accessibility constraints
- content_review_gate/v1 separating draft, reviewer approval, legal/compliance needs, publish/send/file-export authority, and stop condition
- content_output_manifest/v1 only when produced draft, revision diff, approval, export, publish, or delivery evidence is observed

Safety rules:

- A content operator card is not source retrieval, fact verification, hallucination-free copy, stakeholder approval, publishing, email/message sending, file export, delivery, or proof that final copy was accepted unless observed content output evidence records it.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `content-operator`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill content-operator --harness content-operator --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
