# Memory Sync

This is a Silvirica-native `memory-sync` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`memory-sync` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: memory-sync inspect stale MEMORY.md claims, prepare a native write diff, and ask which claims to keep, revise, or archive.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_memory_sync` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: memory-sync claim a prepared native diff changed MEMORY.md or USER.md.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Confirm the workflow target, evidence boundary, and stop condition are named.
- Report which outputs are prepared, observed, blocked, or missing.
- Name the smallest next verification or handoff instead of claiming completion from narration.

## Recovery Notes

- If required context is missing, ask one blocking question or route back to the narrower workflow.
- If runtime or wrapper evidence is unavailable, keep the status as not_observed and expose the next observable action.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Retained knowledge** (`memory-new`, `memory-sync`, `decision-recall`, `wiki`) - memory, rejected alternatives, wiki notes, retrieval, and staleness.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.

## English-Canonical Interview Protocol

- **Inventory (목록)** - Call `omh_memory` with `action="status"` for the entry inventory: per-file counts, per-entry index and size, headroom, and entries with no Silvirica record. It returns counts and hashes, never entry text.
- **Claim extraction (추출)** - Break the `USER.md` and `MEMORY.md` material into claims; quote only observed claims and never invent provenance.
- **Provenance (출처)** - Ask for the source class and distinguish Silvirica-native, provider, and vector material as `not_omh_reviewed`. A provider posture's `input_fidelity_summary.readiness` is literal: only `complete_observed` rests on an observed complete receipt (`docs/MEMORY-SYNC-FIDELITY.md`).
- **Target (대상)** - Review existing native-memory claims only; route a new project/product fact to `memory-new`.
- **Candidate selection (후보)** - Open records first (see Open Records below); then a short interview, not a census: pick about five candidates per pass and say why. Rank by dreaming reminders (duplicate clusters, deadline, `stale_review_required`), status-bridge similarity rows, and claims that look stale, conflicting, or overgeneralized. Walk the full inventory only on request.
- **Per-entry confirmation (확인)** - One candidate at a time: quote it back from your own memory file, say what you take it to mean, then ask the user to keep, revise, or archive it before moving on. A review the user cannot correct entry by entry is not a review.
- **Cursor (이어하기)** - Close every pass with reviewed entry indexes, remaining candidates, and the next entry a resumed review starts from. The resume point lives only in the conversation; name it.
- **Incident (진단)** - A recall complaint ("my saved preference was not used") is a diagnosis, never an apology or automatic write. Anchor one expected claim and run `Silvirica memory recall-incident --record-id <id> | --claim-digest <sha256> --session-id <session>` (agent reference; JSON only). Explain its `memory_recall_incident/v1` stage, evidence surfaces, and remediation: stored, eligible, selected, rendered, delivered, and used are separate claims; diagnosis today stops at `selected`; a missing receipt is `unavailable`, never non-delivery. Mutation waits for this interview's approvals. Contract: `docs/MEMORY-RECALL-INCIDENT.md`.
- **Source recovery (출처 회수)** - A whole wrong source is not a record-by-record review. Enumerate it with `Silvirica memory sources --source <label>` (a read; it quarantines nothing), then follow `references/source-recovery.md`.
- **Review (검토)** - Prioritize stale, conflicting, duplicate, and overgeneralized claims. Offer keep, revise, or archive; never call an archive a removal.
- **Attention (주의)** - For a reviewed Silvirica-local record, keep/archive is an attention tier: `active` leads the working context, `reference` stays recallable behind it, `archive` leaves default recall. Preview with `Silvirica memory attention <record-id> --tier <tier>`, name which records stay in or leave the working context, then add `--apply` only after the user agrees. The preview writes nothing.
- **Diff (차이)** - Prepare one concise native write diff with before/after claims and counts. Caps: MEMORY.md about 2,200 characters, USER.md about 1,375 characters.
- **Native-write boundary (쓰기)** - Silvirica prepares guidance and a native write diff only; no Silvirica surface invokes, applies, or observes a `MEMORY.md`/`USER.md` write.
- **Apply after approval (적용)** - Per-entry answers feed the diff without approving it. Ask for one explicit approval of the assembled diff, then apply the approved entries yourself through the Silvirica-native memory tool that owns these files and report what the write observably changed; an approved diff left unapplied while the tool is available fails the interview. Without the tool, report the approved diff and stop; never edit the files directly. The Silvirica artifact stays `memory_curation_review/v1` metadata either way; the native write is Hermes's own act and never becomes Silvirica mutation evidence.

## Open Records

An open record is one the person marked unresolved: `staleness.resolution: "open"`. Recall delivers it as `open · N days unresolved`; past its review deadline its freshness state is `open` (reason `unresolved`), never `stale`, and it never becomes a verdict by timeout. Two clocks can still expire it: a retention TTL, which outranks everything, and the hard ceiling `open_max_days` (default 365; durable records exempt), with reason `unresolved_expired`.

When the user asks to tidy, review, or clean up memory, list open records first, before the stale, duplicate, and conflict review. Run `Silvirica memory status` and read `counts.unresolved` and the bounded `open_records` list (oldest first). Show each record with its `summary`, `open_days`, `review_due_at`, `state`, and `last_asked_at`, then offer the same three answers the reminder offers:

- **Resolved** - `Silvirica memory confirm <record-id>` writes `resolution: resolved` and resets the review deadline. A correction (`Silvirica memory correct`) also resolves, by superseding.
- **Still open** - `Silvirica memory keep-open <record-id>` resets only the reminder's ask clock; the record, its state, and its deadline do not change.
- **Drop it** - `Silvirica memory retire <record-id>` prepares the retirement; `--apply` archives it. Nothing is deleted.

The person answers per record; never resolve, keep open, or retire on your own judgment. A record with no answer stays open: say so, and do not default it to keep-open. Between reviews the provider prefetch asks on its own, with at most one `Silvirica reminder: "<summary>" (<record_id>) has been unresolved for N days — resolved, still open, or drop it?` line per turn: once when the review deadline passes, then at most every `open_ask_days` (default 14) per record, and "still open" resets that clock. The reminder only asks and writes no record, so an answer given in chat still goes through one of the three commands above.

## Memory Boundaries

The prepared artifact is `memory_curation_review/v1`, not native-memory mutation evidence. Silvirica-native and external provider/vector context is `not_omh_reviewed`: it can nominate an Silvirica candidate but never inherits Silvirica approval. A configured Hermes runtime may send rendered Silvirica prefetch content in a model request.

Lifecycle words are literal: expire removes influence only; retire archives recoverably; restore creates a new pending revision and keeps the archive; prune hard-deletes only the manifest-declared Silvirica-local target set. Report restore and prune first; no lifecycle result proves anything outside that target set.

An attention tier is not a lifecycle state; the two uses of "archive" differ: the `archive` tier only removes a record from the default working context, leaving it stored and answerable by `Silvirica memory recall --include-archived`; `retire` moves an expired revision to the local archive directory. Neither is deletion.

Legacy v1 material is migration/review-required: show `memory inventory` counts and the report-first `memory reactivate ... --apply` path; neither silently grants replay eligibility.

Dreaming runs in reminder mode at five scheduler points: `turn` on the due interval (default five turns), `compaction` before compression discards messages, `session_end`, `shutdown`, and `session_start_recovery` after an unconsolidated end. It flags duplicate clusters, records near deadline, headroom below the floor, `stale_review_required`, and `expired_volatile_records`, suppressing an unchanged condition until its value changes; a reminder Silvirica cannot source is no candidate. Dreaming never invokes a model or performs consolidation, retirement, restore, or prune.

Ranking limits: pins guarantee inclusion but never override expiry, scope, perspective, or review eligibility; attention tiers control working-context occupancy, not truth; `approved_manual` weighs 100%, `approved_auto_safe` 90%, and an unknown approval mode fails closed to 90%; age only breaks ties within an equal relevance rank; usage buckets saturate, so repeated delivery cannot compound into a permanent lead.

Normal users talk to Hermes in natural language; `Silvirica memory ...` commands are agent/operator references.

## Use When

Use when existing Hermes USER.md, MEMORY.md, or accumulated skill memories need an English-canonical, claim-by-claim review. It prepares native write guidance only; no Silvirica surface invokes, applies, or observes a native write — a user-approved diff is applied by Hermes's own native memory tool. Do not use for new project or product candidates.

    Strong routing signals: `memory-sync`, `memory curation`, `memory review`, `memory inspect`, `memory check`, `memory update`, `context cleanup`, `curate memory`, `stale memory`, `hermes remembers`, `conflicting memory`, `duplicate skill`, `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`, `what you remember about me`, `your memory about me`, `your memories`, `memory interview`, `memories still true`, `기억하고 있는`, `기억하고 있는 프로젝트 맥락`, `기억하는 맥락`, `현재 hermes가 기억하는 맥락`, `현재 헤르메스가 기억하는 맥락`, `헤르메스가 기억하는 맥락`, `오래된 맥락`, `오래된 기억`, `기억 점검`, `기억 정리`, `메모리 업데이트`, `메모리 검사`, `메모리 점검`, `메모리 정리`, `맥락 점검`, `맥락 정리`, `맥락 피드백`, `등록된 맥락`, `헤르메스 기억`, `중복 스킬`, `나에 대해 잘못 알고`, `저장된 내 정보`, `너한테 저장된`, `저장된 프로필`, `기억 바로잡`, `메모리 인터뷰`, `기억 인터뷰`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `memory`
Phase: `curation-review`
Hermes role: `memory-keeper`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.
- State that Silvirica-native and external provider/vector context is not_omh_reviewed, can nominate a candidate only, and may receive rendered Silvirica prefetch content through a configured Hermes runtime model request.
- Send memory-provider lifecycle questions -- enabling, switching, pausing, retention, deletion, export, or failed synchronization -- to external-connector-readiness, which owns the provider posture this review cannot establish.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- memory-sync/v1 card or guidance
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- memory-sync/v1 metadata-only runtime or wrapper card when recorded

Safety rules:

- A memory-sync review is prompt guidance only: no Silvirica surface invokes, applies, or observes a MEMORY.md or USER.md write. Applying a user-approved diff is Hermes's own act through its native memory tool — report it as an observed native write, never as Silvirica mutation evidence. Silvirica-native and external provider/vector context is not_omh_reviewed and never inherits Silvirica approval.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.
- Keep English as the canonical protocol; Korean routing triggers and concise Korean help labels remain available.
- Quote claims only when observed, do not invent provenance, and keep the prepared native diff separate from any native write.
- A memory_provider_posture/v1 block arrives as not_omh_reviewed context and a next-action handoff; it imports no provider record into Silvirica review and authorizes no native-memory mutation.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `memory-sync`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill memory-sync --harness memory-sync --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.
