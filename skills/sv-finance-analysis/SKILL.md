# Finance Analysis

This is a Silvirica-native `finance-analysis` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`finance-analysis` prepares a source-bounded decision brief without claiming an authoritative financial action.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is for a current quote, exchange rate, crypto price, or other live market lookup; use `live-info-operator`.
- The user wants generic exploration of a supplied CSV or table without accounting periods, controls, or finance decision framing; use `data-analysis`.
- The user asks to post journal entries, reconcile accounts, approve payments, submit tax filings, or configure an accounting system; use `connector-operator` for an explicit observed action path.
- The user wants pipeline coverage, deal health, or a seller forecast scenario rather than authoritative revenue or close reporting; use `sales-pipeline-review`.
- The user needs an enterprise or product direction decision after analysis; route that decision to `strategy-brief`.
- The ask is testing whether an internal control operated -- a SOX or ICFR sample, re-performance, or a deficiency's severity; use `internal-audit`.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: Compare Q2 actuals against budget, explain the biggest expense variances, and flag cash risks for the CFO.
- Expected behavior: Prepare the period boundary, actual-versus-plan narrative, cash-risk register, and decision questions.
- Why: The supplied finance framing needs a bounded decision brief rather than an external accounting action.

Bad example:

- Prompt: What is the USD/KRW exchange rate right now?
- Expected behavior: Route to `live-info-operator`, not `finance-analysis`.
- Why: A live exchange rate needs observed provider data rather than a finance analysis brief.

## Completion Checklist

- Confirm the workflow target, evidence boundary, and stop condition are named.
- Report which outputs are prepared, observed, blocked, or missing.
- Name the smallest next verification or handoff instead of claiming completion from narration.

## Recovery Notes

- If required context is missing, ask one blocking question or route back to the narrower workflow.
- If runtime or wrapper evidence is unavailable, keep the status as not_observed and expose the next observable action.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Research and company ops** (`product-docs`, `source-finder`, `web-research`, `research`, `model-optimization`, `inference-serving`, `model-finetuning`, `research-brief`, `+20 more`) - research, signals, ops, and briefings.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when supplied ledger, budget, forecast, revenue, expense, cash-flow, or close context needs a bounded analysis and decision brief.

    Strong routing signals: `finance analysis`, `budget variance`, `budget vs actual`, `month-end close`, `재무 분석`, `예산 대비 실적`, `월마감`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `operations`
Phase: `finance-analysis`
Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `evidence-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Separate supplied numbers, assumptions, and missing finance evidence.
- Keep decision and escalation questions explicit.

Handoff policy:

Keep domain framing, clarification, source/evidence synthesis, draft outputs, and next-work routing in Hermes. A prepared brief, review, reply, or plan is not an external action, approval, filing, send, publish, data mutation, implementation, review, CI, or merge claim. Prepare a connector, file, coding, or human-review handoff only when the user explicitly accepts that next step; report it only from observed evidence. Calculations are only as authoritative as supplied or observed sources and methods; no ERP, bank, ledger, tax, payment, or filing action is implied.

Required inputs:

- period
- supplied finance source
- decision question
- calculation assumptions

Expert clarification questions:
- `period`
  - English: What period, cutoff, reporting entity/perimeter, currency/units, accounting basis, comparator version, and close status apply?
  - Korean: 어떤 기간, 마감 기준일, 보고 법인과 범위, 통화와 단위, 회계 기준, 비교 버전, 마감 상태를 적용해야 하나요?

Expected outputs:

- finance_scope_source_record/v1
- finance_reconciliation_analysis_schedule/v1
- finance_risk_register/v1
- finance_decision_brief/v1

Artifact expectations:

- prepared finance analysis brief when a wrapper captures it

Safety rules:

- State source and calculation assumptions before presenting a variance.
- Do not imply an ERP, bank, ledger, tax, payment, or filing action occurred.

Procedure: load `references/procedure.md`.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `ops-review`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill finance-analysis --harness ops-review --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
