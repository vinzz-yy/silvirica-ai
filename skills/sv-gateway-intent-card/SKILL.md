# Gateway Intent Card

This is a Silvirica-native `gateway-intent-card` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`gateway-intent-card` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: gateway-intent-card route this Discord thread update silently unless action is needed.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_gateway_intent_card` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: gateway-intent-card prove the Telegram attachment was sent.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- The origin platform, thread/session boundary, delivery target, and update policy are named.
- Prepared card or command output is separate from platform registration, send, attachment, or delivery evidence.
- The next wrapper action is explicit and platform-safe.

## Recovery Notes

- If platform metadata is missing, keep the card platform-neutral and ask for the target surface.
- If send or registration evidence is unavailable, show the adapter-owned action instead of claiming delivery.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when Hermes needs platform-neutral gateway policy for a chat session, thread, delivery target, attachment, or status update.

    Strong routing signals: `gateway-intent-card`, `gateway intent`, `discord thread`, `slack thread`, `telegram delivery`, `discord delivery policy`, `slack delivery policy`, `telegram delivery policy`, `discord status update`, `slack status update`, `telegram status update`, `gateway delivery`, `gateway notification`, `channel delivery`, `session delivery`, `silent update`, `attachment policy`, `status update policy`, `webhook delivery`, `게이트웨이`, `디스코드`, `슬랙`, `텔레그램`, `알림`, `전달`, `채널`, `조용히`, `스레드`, `보내줘`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `gateway`
Phase: `intent-card`
Hermes role: `guide`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- gateway-intent-card/v1 card or guidance
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- gateway-intent-card/v1 metadata-only runtime or wrapper card when recorded

Safety rules:

- A gateway intent card is not platform login, message send, thread mutation, attachment upload, or delivery evidence.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `gateway-intent-card`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill gateway-intent-card --harness gateway-intent-card --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
