# Media Input Operator

This is a Silvirica-native `media-input-operator` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`media-input-operator` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: media-input-operator transcribe this audio meeting and summarize action items with evidence and timestamp boundaries.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_media_input_card` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: media-input-operator invent a YouTube transcript and claim the timestamps are verified without media evidence.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Media type, source location, permission boundary, transcript availability, language, requested output, timestamp requirement, and stop condition are explicit.
- Downloads, uploads, ASR, transcript extraction, speaker labels, copyrighted media access, and provider setup are gated or marked missing.
- Transcript text, OCR output, screenshot text, receipt fields, timestamps, quotes, action items, and media-summary claims are reported only from observed media or supplied transcript/extraction evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If the media or transcript is missing, ask for the smallest source, file, transcript, or provider result needed.
- If the request is broad current-source research about a video topic, route to research or source-finder before summary.
- If the user wants a PPT/PDF/report generated from the media summary, route to materials-package after media input evidence is clear.
- If the request is about whether a live duplex voice connector keeps whole spoken turns, route to external-connector-readiness for a realtime_voice_trial_receipt/v1 rather than treating a supplied recording as that evidence.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Materials and visual summaries** (`design-orchestration`, `apple-design`, `design-quality-gate`, `award-bar-score`, `frontend`, `accessibility-audit`, `visual-qa`, `content-operator`, `+6 more`) - web, accessibility, visual QA, files, and packages.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should prepare or supervise audio/video transcript, YouTube/video summary, OCR, screenshot text extraction, receipt image parsing, or timestamped media extraction work without claiming media access, download, transcription, OCR output, or factual summary evidence.

    Strong routing signals: `media-input-operator`, `media input operator`, `media input`, `audio transcription`, `audio transcript`, `transcribe audio`, `transcribe this audio`, `meeting recording`, `recording transcript`, `video transcript`, `youtube summary`, `youtube video`, `summarize youtube`, `summarize this youtube`, `video summary`, `summarize this video`, `ocr image`, `image ocr`, `photo ocr`, `picture ocr`, `graphic ocr`, `screenshot ocr`, `ocr this image`, `ocr receipt image`, `ocr this receipt image`, `receipt ocr`, `receipt image ocr`, `receipt text`, `receipt text from image`, `receipt fields`, `receipt fields from image`, `receipt image extraction`, `receipt image text`, `receipt image fields`, `parse receipt image`, `receipt image parse`, `receipt image into fields`, `image text extraction`, `extract text from image`, `extract text from this image`, `screenshot text extraction`, `extract text from screenshot`, `extract text from this screenshot`, `screenshot to text`, `timestamps`, `with timestamps`, `clip summary`, `podcast summary`, `webinar summary`, `오디오 전사`, `음성 전사`, `회의 녹음`, `녹음 요약`, `영상 요약`, `유튜브 요약`, `youtube 요약`, `이미지 ocr`, `이미지 OCR`, `이미지 텍스트 추출`, `이미지에서 텍스트 추출`, `영수증 ocr`, `영수증 OCR`, `영수증 이미지 ocr`, `영수증 이미지 OCR`, `스크린샷 텍스트 추출`, `스크린샷에서 텍스트 추출`, `타임스탬프`, `타임라인 요약`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `media`
Phase: `media-input-task`
Hermes role: `guide`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- media_input_task_card/v1
- media_source_scope/v1
- transcript_boundary/v1
- media_summary_plan/v1
- media_result_manifest/v1 when observed
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- media_input_task_card/v1 metadata-only wrapper card when prepared
- media_source_scope/v1 with media type, source location, permission boundary, requested time range, and stop condition
- transcript_boundary/v1 separating supplied transcript, missing transcript, ASR/extraction requirement, language, speaker labels, and confidence gaps
- media_summary_plan/v1 naming action-item, timestamped, clip, chapter, quote, or evidence-linked summary method
- media_result_manifest/v1 only when supplied transcript, media file metadata, provider response, or observed transcript output exists

Safety rules:

- A media input card is not media access, file upload, download, transcript extraction, OCR output, screenshot text extraction, receipt fields, speech-to-text output, timestamp accuracy, copyright clearance, source retrieval, or summary correctness evidence unless observed media-result evidence records it.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.
- A media_result_manifest/v1 describes a supplied recording or transcript. It is never a live duplex session, one-input-to-one-dispatch integrity, audible response behavior, or realtime voice readiness, and it cannot be promoted into one.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `media-input-operator`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill media-input-operator --harness media-input-operator --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
