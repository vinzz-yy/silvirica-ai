# Ops Observability Card

This is a Silvirica-native `ops-observability-card` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`ops-observability-card` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: ops-observability-card show token, cost, latency, supplied Prometheus/Grafana metrics, and missing service-quality evidence for this loop.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_ops_observability_card` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: ops-observability-card claim exact provider billing, healthy SLO, incident closure, or remediation completion from local estimates.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- The run or workflow scope, metric window, failure modes, and cost/latency boundary are named.
- Local telemetry, provider truth, billing truth, and completion evidence are separate states.
- Warnings name the next measurement or operator review action.

## Recovery Notes

- If provider metrics are unavailable, report only local metadata and mark provider truth not_observed.
- If cost or latency looks risky, surface a warning plus the next measurement rather than a completion claim.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when automation, loops, gateway work, executor handoffs, or service operations need a safe command-board for cost, latency, token, history, failure-mode, supplied metric-provider, and service-quality visibility.

    Strong routing signals: `ops-observability-card`, `observability card`, `operations command board`, `ops command board`, `service quality board`, `service quality`, `external metric provider`, `metric provider`, `prometheus metrics`, `grafana metrics`, `cost telemetry`, `latency telemetry`, `token telemetry`, `run history`, `loop telemetry`, `failure mode`, `monitor tokens`, `service health`, `slo dashboard`, `비용`, `토큰`, `지연시간`, `관측성`, `운영 지휘판`, `서비스 품질`, `메트릭`, `프로메테우스`, `그라파나`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `observability`
Phase: `telemetry-card`
Hermes role: `tracker`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.
- When advising what to record per model call, require the five answers - which model, how long, how many tokens in and out, whether it succeeded, and why it failed - with streaming calls adding time-to-first-token; the attribute tiers live in `Silvirica-agent-ops-review/references/instrumentation-ladder.md`.
- Aggregate cost at the four levels - per call, per agent run, per session, per user - and name the budget threshold each level checks against before recommending any optimization signal.
- Never recommend logging raw prompts, responses, or secret values into telemetry; counts, lengths, hashes, and key-set booleans carry the signal without the leak.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- ops-observability-card/v1 card or guidance
- external_metric_provider/v1 payload contract
- external_metric_provider_adapter/v1 adapter contract
- ops_service_quality_board/v1 service-quality board
- typed service-quality downgrade gaps
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- ops-observability-card/v1 metadata-only runtime or wrapper card when recorded
- external_metric_provider/v1 supplied metric payload when available
- external_metric_provider_adapter/v1 connector-ready adapter metadata when available
- ops_service_quality_board/v1 evidence-gated service-quality board

Artifact contracts:

This label denotes the machine-enforcement level, not a skill quality score and not an observed evidence state.

- contract_id: `ops_service_quality_board/v1`; enforcement_level: `executable_validated`; consumer_id: `validate_ops_service_quality_board`

Safety rules:

- An ops observability card is not billing truth, provider quota truth, live metric-provider access, complete tracing, SLO pass, incident closure, root-cause proof, remediation completion, performance proof, or successful workflow completion evidence.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `ops-observability-card`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill ops-observability-card --harness ops-observability-card --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
