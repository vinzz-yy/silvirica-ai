# Live Info Operator

This is a Silvirica-native `live-info-operator` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`live-info-operator` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: live-info-operator check today's Seoul weather with freshness, units, and provider boundaries before answering.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_live_info_operator_card` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: live-info-operator invent the latest stock price without provider evidence or timestamp.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Domain, location or symbol, time window, provider preference, freshness, units, and stop condition are explicit.
- Provider setup, API access, source quality, stale data, and missing location/symbol decisions are gated or marked missing.
- Weather, price, score, exchange-rate, time-zone, map, place, and traffic facts are reported only from observed provider evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If the provider, plugin, API key, or connector is missing, route to toolbelt-readiness before preparing result claims.
- If the request asks for citations, best practices, docs, or broad current-source synthesis, route to research instead.
- If the request would create, update, invite, send, or mutate external provider state, route to connector-operator instead.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should prepare or supervise read-only live information lookups without claiming provider availability, API access, freshness, retrieval, or result correctness.

    Strong routing signals: `live-info-operator`, `live info operator`, `live information`, `real time information`, `real-time information`, `weather today`, `current weather`, `weather forecast`, `stock price`, `crypto price`, `btc price`, `exchange rate`, `sports score`, `game score`, `time zone`, `timezone`, `time in`, `map directions`, `directions to`, `near me`, `nearby restaurants`, `traffic now`, `오늘 날씨`, `현재 날씨`, `날씨 예보`, `주가`, `코인 가격`, `환율`, `스포츠 점수`, `경기 결과`, `시간대`, `현재 시간`, `지도`, `길찾기`, `주변 식당`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `live-info`
Phase: `live-info-task`
Hermes role: `guide`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- live_info_task_card/v1
- live_info_scope/v1
- freshness_boundary/v1
- live_info_result_manifest/v1 when observed
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- live_info_task_card/v1 metadata-only wrapper card when prepared
- live_info_scope/v1 with domain, location or symbol, time window, provider preference, units, and stop condition
- freshness_boundary/v1 separating requested recency, provider timestamp, source quality, and stale-result handling
- live_info_result_manifest/v1 only when provider response, timestamp, quote/source id, or rendered result is observed

Safety rules:

- A live information card is not provider availability, API access, live data retrieval, weather, market price, sports score, exchange-rate, time-zone, map, or place-result evidence unless observed live-info result evidence records it.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `live-info-operator`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill live-info-operator --harness live-info-operator --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
