# Physical Device Readiness

This is a Silvirica-native `physical-device-readiness` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`physical-device-readiness` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: physical-device-readiness check Snapmaker printer safety with camera gate, slicer dry-run, heat command approval, and emergency-stop evidence before printing.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_physical_device_readiness` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: physical-device-readiness start the printer, heat the bed, flip relays, and claim the robot is safe without observed operator approval or device telemetry.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Device scope, actuator and hazard classes, sensor/camera gates, operator approval, dry-run policy, emergency stop, and stop condition are explicit.
- Physical actions, heat commands, relay toggles, robot movement, print starts, camera inspections, and telemetry readings are marked observed, missing, risky, or not_observed.
- Route external APIs or provider setup to external-connector-readiness, terminal commands to command-operator, safety concerns to security-safety-review, visual/camera checks to visual-qa, and missing tools to toolbelt-readiness.
- Do not claim device movement, heat, print, relay, robot, camera, sensor, or emergency-stop success without observed device-trial evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If the device, workspace, actuator, or authority is unclear, keep readiness blocked until the missing safety context is named.
- If the user asks to execute commands, move hardware, heat a bed/nozzle, flip a relay, or start a print, route to command-operator or connector-operator and require observed operator approval before any execution claim.
- If camera or telemetry evidence is required but unavailable, route to visual-qa or toolbelt-readiness and keep the physical device readiness card prepared_not_observed.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use before preparing or adopting a workflow that could move, heat, print, actuate, unlock, or otherwise affect physical devices so safety envelope, sensor/camera gates, dry-run policy, operator approval, emergency stop, and observation requirements are explicit.

    Strong routing signals: `physical-device-readiness`, `physical device readiness`, `device safety readiness`, `physical device safety`, `hardware safety gate`, `3d printer readiness`, `3D printer safety`, `snapmaker printer safety`, `snapmaker readiness`, `moonraker klipper safety`, `camera-gated print start`, `camera gate`, `heat command approval`, `iot relay safety`, `sensor relay safety`, `robotics safety`, `robot control readiness`, `vla robot readiness`, `mushroom cultivation relay safety`, `raspberry pi relay safety`, `물리 장비 안전`, `하드웨어 안전`, `3d 프린터 안전`, `프린터 안전`, `로봇 제어 준비`, `iot 릴레이 안전`, `센서 릴레이 안전`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `operations`
Phase: `device-readiness`
Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- physical_device_readiness_card/v1
- device_safety_envelope/v1
- hazard_and_actuator_inventory/v1
- sensor_camera_gate_policy/v1
- operator_approval_policy/v1
- dry_run_and_simulation_policy/v1
- emergency_stop_and_rollback_plan/v1
- device_trial_manifest/v1 when observed
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- physical_device_readiness_card/v1 metadata-only wrapper card when prepared
- device_safety_envelope/v1 with device, workspace, hazards, actuator classes, human/property risk, owner, authority, and stop condition
- hazard_and_actuator_inventory/v1 separating motion, heat, pressure, electrical, relay, network, credential, and environmental risks
- sensor_camera_gate_policy/v1 for camera/OCR, sensor telemetry, stale readings, manual inspection, and blocked/no-camera fallback
- operator_approval_policy/v1 with explicit human authority, confirmation moment, disallowed autonomous actions, and emergency contact or stop owner
- dry_run_and_simulation_policy/v1 for slicer/G-code dry-runs, command previews, mock relays, simulated robot paths, and no-hardware trial mode
- emergency_stop_and_rollback_plan/v1 with stop command, power/network isolation, recovery boundary, and abort condition
- device_trial_manifest/v1 only when real telemetry, camera capture id, dry-run output, command transcript, operator confirmation, or hardware observation is recorded

Safety rules:

- A physical device readiness card is not device discovery, network pairing, credential validation, slicer output, G-code safety, camera inspection, sensor reading, relay actuation, robot movement, heat command, print start, emergency stop test, or successful hardware trial evidence unless observed device-trial evidence records it.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `physical-device-readiness`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill physical-device-readiness --harness physical-device-readiness --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
