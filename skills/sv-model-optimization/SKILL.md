# Model Optimization

This is a Silvirica-native `model-optimization` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`model-optimization` exists so a new model release triggers one repeatable, evidence-ordered process instead of ad-hoc edits: recognition proves what the router sees, official-first research separates contracts from folklore, trait-to-counter keeps calibrations concrete, and the measurement close keeps them honest.

## Do Not Use When

- The user wants their own machine's model routing configured or providers connected; use `model-setup`.
- The goal is measurable performance of an application or system, not model handling; use `ultraperf`.
- The user wants benchmark-superiority or provider-readiness claims without measurements.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: GLM 5.3 and 5.3 Flash just shipped; check what we should optimize for them.
- Expected behavior: Probe recognition for both ids, verify family coverage, research the official thinking/tool contract plus community harness handling with labeled sources, draft version-aware trait-to-counter calibration, propose chain placement distinguishing the Flash sibling from the highspeed tier, and name the benchmark pair as the measurement close.
- Why: A new generation of a known family needs the whole process, not just a chain edit.

Bad example:

- Prompt: Just say the new model is the best and route everything to it.
- Expected behavior: Refuse the superiority claim, run the process, and place routing only with owner-approved config or repo changes backed by labeled sources.
- Why: Unmeasured superiority claims and blanket rerouting are exactly what the process exists to prevent.

## Completion Checklist

- Recognition probe output exists for every new id, and the family label is the expected one.
- Every research finding is labeled official, official-client, observed, or community with its source kept.
- The calibration draft counters named traits and marks version-specific rules as such.
- Routing and pricing changes name their surface (operator config vs repo change) and their approval state.
- The measurement plan names the benchmark pair, or the recorded reason none can run, and the worse-measured-calibration rule is stated.

## Recovery Notes

- If official docs and community reports conflict, ship the official contract and record the community finding as an unconfirmed counter-signal.
- If the model cannot be measured (no served route, no credentials), ship the calibration with its research provenance and record the measurement as the named follow-up.
- If a later measurement shows the calibration worse than baseline, revise or remove it in the same change that reports the number.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Research and company ops** (`product-docs`, `source-finder`, `web-research`, `research`, `model-optimization`, `inference-serving`, `model-finetuning`, `research-brief`, `+20 more`) - research, signals, ops, and briefings.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when a model or family is new to Silvirica, shipped a new generation, or changed its serving contract, and the operator wants recognition, calibration, routing, pricing, and docs checked and strengthened for it through the fixed onboarding process.

    Strong routing signals: `model-optimization`, `model optimization`, `optimize for model`, `onboard new model`, `calibrate new model`, `new model calibration`, `model calibration`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `optimization`
Phase: `model-onboarding`
Hermes role: `tracker`
Quality tier: `evidence-gated`
Reasoning demand: `heavy`

Quality bar:

- Probe recognition before researching: `Silvirica coding model-route --executor hermes --model <id> --effort <effort> --role implementation --json` shows the family label the routing engine assigns; an unknown or generic label means the family prefix table needs a row before any calibration can attach.
- Check calibration coverage second: the MODEL_OPTI.md coverage matrix plus both calibration tables (subagent high-effort and composer). A recognized family with no calibration is a tracked gap, not an error.
- Research official docs first — release notes, thinking/tool-calling contract, context and output limits, pricing, speed tiers — then how other open-source harnesses handle the model. Label every finding official, official-client (the vendor's own client source), observed, or community and keep the source; on conflict the earlier label wins.
- Author calibration as trait-to-counter: name the model's documented or observed behavior, then state the concrete counter-behavior, version-aware where generations differ. Do not restate universal protocol rules inside a family entry.
- Distinguish speed tiers from separate models before touching routing: a speed tier is the same weights served faster and projects onto its base model; a separately trained sibling is its own chain entry. Place routing through config surfaces first (Silvirica model-chains set, Silvirica coding category-maestro set); shipped editorial defaults change only as a repo change with explicit owner approval; a superseded generation leaves the shipped chains, and its retired alias stays recognized and priced so a machine-level override still resolves.
- Record cost only from documented list pricing; a model or tier without a documented price gets no entry — absence renders no estimate, never a fabricated number.
- Close with measurement: a calibration ships measurable, and the baseline-vs-optimized benchmark pair is the named follow-up when no served route exists yet. A calibration that measures worse than baseline is revised or removed in the same change that reports the number, never kept.

Handoff policy:

Keep recognition probes, research synthesis, calibration drafting, and the process checklist in Hermes. Machine-local routing placement is a config edit the operator approves; repository changes (prefix table rows, calibration text, shipped chain defaults, docs) are coding work for the selected executor lane. A drafted calibration or prepared route is prepared_not_observed, never execution or benchmark evidence.

Required inputs:

- the model id(s) as served, and the provider or gateway serving them
- recognition probe output for each id
- official release/contract documentation, with community harness findings labeled separately

Expected outputs:

- recognition and calibration coverage verdict for the family
- trait-to-counter calibration draft (or a no-change verdict with reasons)
- routing/pricing placement plan naming config surfaces vs repo changes
- measurement plan naming the benchmark pair or the reason none can run yet

Artifact expectations:

- metadata-only runtime record when a wrapper or shell is available

Safety rules:

- Do not imply hidden Hermes runtime behavior.
- Use the smallest verification that can prove the claim.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `research`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill model-optimization --harness research --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
