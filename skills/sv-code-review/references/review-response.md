# Receiving a Review

Review feedback is a technical claim to evaluate, not a verdict to perform
agreement with. Load this when findings arrive, before changing anything.

## Verify before implementing

1. **Read** the whole set without reacting.
2. **Restate** each item in your own words. If you cannot, you do not understand it yet.
3. **Verify** it against the codebase as it actually is.
4. **Evaluate** whether it is correct *for this project*, not in general.
5. **Respond** with a technical acknowledgement or reasoned push-back.
6. **Implement** one item at a time, checking each.

## The clarification gate is all-or-nothing

If any item is unclear, ask about it **before implementing any of them**.

Findings are frequently related. Implementing the four you understood can make
the two you did not understand harder to fix, or can implement them wrongly by
implication. Partial understanding produces a partial-fix diff that then needs
its own review round.

## Push-back is part of the contract

A reviewer working from a diff has less context than you do. When a finding is
wrong, say so with the technical reason and the evidence - the test that covers
it, the constraint that forbids the suggested shape, the platform it breaks.

Do not implement a change you believe is wrong in order to close a finding. That
trades a review round for a defect.

What is not push-back: silence, partial implementation, or implementing
something adjacent and calling the finding addressed.

## Order the work

1. Anything that blocks other items.
2. Correctness, highest severity first.
3. Everything mechanical.

Re-run the verifying command after each, not once at the end. A batch of fixes
verified together cannot tell you which one regressed.

## What not to say

Performative agreement wastes a turn and hides whether the item was understood.
Skip "you're absolutely right", "great catch", and "let me implement that now" -
restate the requirement, or start working.

## Convergence

From round two, the review is a ratchet: new findings on ground the previous
round already settled need a stated reason they were not visible earlier, and a
finding carried forward keeps the severity it was raised at. See `REVIEW.md` for
the full rule set; this file only covers the reviewee's side.

## Boundary

Reading a finding is not fixing it. A fix is observed only when the command that
demonstrated the defect no longer does.
