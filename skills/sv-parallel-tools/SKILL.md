# Parallel Tools

This is a Silvirica-native `parallel-tools` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`parallel-tools` exists to give a quick, read-first answer to whether parallel tool calls are current and enabled, with an update path only when currency is actually missing.

## Do Not Use When

- The user wants a general Hermes update unrelated to parallel-tool capability.
- No version or capability question has been asked yet.
- The request needs a repository code change rather than a local version check.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: update hermes for parallel tools — can you check if I'm on a current enough version?
- Expected behavior: Read the installed version and capability status, report whether parallel tools are current, and hand back a user-runnable update command if not.
- Why: The request is a version-currency and capability check, the core of this skill.

Bad example:

- Prompt: parallel-tools: update your memory with what we discussed.
- Expected behavior: Route to a memory workflow instead of a version-currency check.
- Why: Memory update is unrelated to parallel-tool capability or Hermes version.

## Completion Checklist

- If a prerequisite is unmet, mark that item "not applicable" and continue with the rest of the guide instead of blocking or guessing.
- Success is applicable-only: verification passes when every applicable item is confirmed complete, not when every possible item exists.
- The reported capability status matches an observed read, not an assumed default.

## Recovery Notes

- If the installed version cannot be read, report the read failure and stop before recommending an update.
- If the update command is unavailable for the user's install path, name the blocker instead of guessing a fix.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when the user wants Hermes to check whether parallel tool calls are current and enabled, run a version-currency check, or report capability status, following the shared prerequisite-check, diagnose, guide, diff-approved apply, and verify contract.

    Strong routing signals: `parallel-tools`, `parallel tools`, `hermes parallel tools setup`, `update hermes for parallel tools`, `check parallel tool support`, `enable parallel tool calls`, `verify parallel tools capability`, `check hermes version for parallel tools`, `헤르메스 업데이트 확인해줘`, `병렬 도구 설정`, `병렬 툴 확인`, `헤르메스 병렬 도구`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `hermes-setup`
Phase: `setup`
Hermes role: `guide`
Quality tier: `hermes-setup-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Prerequisite check: confirm required access; mark unmet prerequisites "not applicable" and skip them.
- Read-only diagnose: inspect non-secret config metadata, `.env` key names and presence only, and version; no secret reads or writes.
- Guide: use Silvirica-native secure entry or user-side OAuth/token setup, never chat secrets.
- Diff-approved apply: show the config or `.env` diff with redacted placeholders; apply only after the user explicitly approves.
- Verify: confirm applicable items using non-secret metadata, never secret values.
- This is mostly a verify-only walkthrough: prefer reporting capability status over proposing a config change when parallel tools are already current.

Handoff policy:

Run diagnosis and reporting directly in Hermes for parallel-tool capability. Diagnosis reads non-secret metadata only; no writes. Show redacted placeholders in the config or `.env` diff; apply only after the user explicitly approves. Never ask the user to paste secrets into chat. Use Silvirica-native secure entry or user-side OAuth/token setup; if unavailable, stop credential application and guide user-side setup. Use only a user-authorized credential store or local configuration; disclose destination and scope first. Keep secrets out of chat, previews, logs and evidence. Do not promise chat or platform non-retention. Delegate to a selected coding executor only if the user needs a change outside a local version/config check.

Required inputs:

- installed Hermes version
- current parallel-tool capability status

Expected outputs:

- read-only diagnosis of the installed version and parallel-tool capability status
- a user-runnable update command to check or restore version currency
- a capability status report naming which parallel-tool features are active

Artifact expectations:

- capability status note when the wrapper captures it

Safety rules:

- Do not name a specific version number, release date, or product tier; read and report the installed version instead of assuming one.
- Report the update command for the user to run themselves rather than claiming Hermes restarted or reloaded on its own.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `hermes-setup`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill parallel-tools --harness hermes-setup --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
