# Apple Design

This is a Silvirica-native `apple-design` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`apple-design` turns Apple UI design, review, and improvement requests into a platform-aware brief that respects native and web differences while preserving Silvirica's existing implementation and evidence owners.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is generic frontend design, accessibility, screenshot QA, image-card work, or material guidance without an Apple-specific phrase or explicit `apple-design` invocation; use the existing specialist lane.
- The message concerns Apple fruit, stock, support, a glass database, material science, or unrelated Swift/macOS discussion.
- The user needs a conformance, accessibility PASS, or visual PASS claim without supplied and observed evidence.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: Review this iPad checkout against Apple HIG and hand the concrete fixes to the frontend and accessibility owners.
- Expected behavior: Prepare apple_design_brief/v1 with applicable evidence, findings, platform-aware remediation, and the existing owner routes.
- Why: The request specifies an Apple platform and asks for a review plus downstream remediation without treating the brief as implementation or a verdict.

Bad example:

- Prompt: Call our generic WCAG screenshot check Apple-certified.
- Expected behavior: Keep the Apple-specific verdict unavailable and route generic accessibility or rendered evidence to the existing specialist.
- Why: A generic check without applicable Apple evidence cannot establish platform compliance or certification.

## Completion Checklist

- Target, convention, state, and evidence are explicit.
- Each direction or finding names evidence, source applicability, owner, and missing verification; product visuals name original art direction.
- Implementation remains with the selected coding owner; accessibility and visual completion remain not_observed until their existing lanes record evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If the platform/version, convention, or target state is missing, ask for it before treating a guideline as applicable.
- If no supplied screen or code exists, prepare the brief and mark visual status not_observed rather than inferring a rendered result.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Materials and visual summaries** (`design-orchestration`, `apple-design`, `design-quality-gate`, `award-bar-score`, `frontend`, `accessibility-audit`, `visual-qa`, `content-operator`, `+6 more`) - web, accessibility, visual QA, files, and packages.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when an iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Apple-inspired web surface, or explicit Apple-style product visual needs an Apple-aware direction, evidence-backed review, or improvement brief before implementation or visual verification.

    Strong routing signals: `apple-design`, `apple design`, `apple ui design`, `apple hig`, `human interface guidelines`, `ios design guidelines`, `macos app design`, `apple-inspired web`, `liquid glass review`, `liquid glass design`, `apple 3d hero`, `apple-style 3d`, `apple product render`, `apple product visual`, `apple studio lighting`, `apple-style landing visual`, `apple product page`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `materials`
Phase: `apple-design`
Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `apple-design-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Start with mode, target, convention, and available evidence; choose directions before visuals when open.
- Load `references/platform-foundations.md`, `references/materials-and-accessibility.md`, `references/product-visual-production.md`, `references/web-production-libraries.md`, and `references/review-playbook.md` for their named boundaries.
- For product work, use reference -> actual production -> same-subject comparison -> revision. Motion needs frames, video, or browser evidence and a reduced-motion alternative; do not award an Apple score.
- Findings name evidence, impact, source/applicability, fix, owner, and missing check; route implementation to the selected owner and proof to accessibility-audit or visual-qa.

Handoff policy:

Hermes directs; selected owners implement and existing lanes observe.

Required inputs:

- mode: design, review, or improve
- visual target: Apple marketing/product visual, native Apple application, or Apple-inspired web UI
- target, surface/state, supplied evidence, and available execution constraints

Expected outputs:

- apple_design_brief/v1
- apple_visual_direction/v1
- apple_design_finding/v1 with severity, location/evidence, impact, source/applicability, fix, owner, and missing checks
- two to four design directions before visual work when direction is open
- composed remediation route to frontend, design-quality-gate, accessibility-audit, visual-qa, or award-bar-score

Artifact expectations:

- prepared Apple design brief with observations and hypotheses distinguished
- prepared product-visual handoff when no authorized execution path exists
- visual status not_observed when no supplied screen, capture, or rendered surface exists
- no Apple certification, accessibility PASS, visual PASS, or implementation claim from a prepared brief

Safety rules:

- Choose one target: marketing/product visual, native Apple application, or Apple-inspired web UI; do not substitute marketing or web effects for native controls/Liquid Glass.
- For native targets use current HIG/system controls and platform foundations; macOS has no Dynamic Type. For web, use semantic responsive UI with reduced-motion/transparency and opaque fallback.
- Product visuals use original geometry, camera, material, light, palette, scale, copy-safe space, and no Apple assets; see the production reference for renderer choices.
- Only call a result generated, rendered, or animated with matching actual evidence. Without an authorized execution path, prepare a handoff and name the missing boundary.
- Load the web-library reference only for explicit Apple product work; confirm existing-project compatibility and license posture. Do not install, vendor, fetch, or call it native Apple; generic GSAP/logo work stays in its existing lane.
- Review supplied evidence; prepared guidance is not implementation, accessibility/visual PASS, or certification.
- Before output and before approval, classify native, web, or marketing intent; use `apple-design` only for the explicit specialist request.
- If current source guidance applies, keep its conditional 35% bright-background note; it is not universal. When no renderer is available, do not claim a result; while work is prepared, it is not observed.
- Never treat web glass as native, never substitute a still for motion, and use only actual evidence after production; without it, the result is not PASS.
- While evidence is missing, use only a prepared handoff; it is not execution and not a PASS.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `apple-design`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill apple-design --harness apple-design --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
