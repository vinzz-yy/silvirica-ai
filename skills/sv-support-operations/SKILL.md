# Support Operations

This is a Silvirica-native `support-operations` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`support-operations` turns a bounded customer case into response and escalation guidance without treating drafts or recommendations as helpdesk actions.

## Do Not Use When

- The request clusters a backlog of customer signals to find product patterns or roadmap candidates; use `feedback-triage`.
- The user only needs a generic, non-support marketing or email rewrite with no case, severity, or escalation context; use `content-operator`.
- The request asks to send a reply, change ticket priority or status, issue a refund, modify an account, or update a helpdesk; use `connector-operator` with an explicit target and observed result.
- The request is an incident that is still open, needing severity declared, a commander assigned, and a running timeline rather than a support-case response; use `live-incident-response`.
- The request is a closed incident's postmortem or reliability evidence rather than a support-case response; use `reliability-review`.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: Draft a calm reply for this login-outage customer and tell me whether it needs an engineering escalation.
- Expected behavior: Prepare a customer-safe reply, severity matrix, engineering escalation recommendation, and owner handoff.
- Why: The request is one support case with reply and escalation decisions, not a feedback backlog or ticket mutation.

Bad example:

- Prompt: Cluster last quarter's support feedback into roadmap opportunities.
- Expected behavior: Route to `feedback-triage`, not `support-operations`.
- Why: A historical signal backlog needs product-pattern triage rather than case-level support guidance.

## Completion Checklist

- The source boundary, signal clusters, severity, and follow-up lane are named.
- Bug, feature, research, strategy, and coding handoff outcomes stay separate.
- The next workflow is recommended before any implementation claim.

## Recovery Notes

- If feedback lacks source or severity, ask for the missing signal before coding handoff.
- If the item is actually a plan or research request, route to that workflow instead of triage.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Research and company ops** (`product-docs`, `source-finder`, `web-research`, `research`, `model-optimization`, `inference-serving`, `model-finetuning`, `research-brief`, `+20 more`) - research, signals, ops, and briefings.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.

## Use When

Use when one or a bounded set of support contacts needs response drafting, urgency classification, incident/escalation routing, and follow-up ownership.

    Strong routing signals: `support escalation`, `customer support reply`, `ticket triage`, `고객 지원 에스컬레이션`, `고객 답변 초안`, `지원 티켓 분류`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `triage`
Phase: `support-operations`
Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `triage-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- State issue, severity, impact, evidence gaps, owner, and next route.
- Draft a reply without treating it as a sent customer communication.

Handoff policy:

Keep domain framing, clarification, source/evidence synthesis, draft outputs, and next-work routing in Hermes. A prepared brief, review, reply, or plan is not an external action, approval, filing, send, publish, data mutation, implementation, review, CI, or merge claim. Prepare a connector, file, coding, or human-review handoff only when the user explicitly accepts that next step; report it only from observed evidence. Reply text is a draft, escalation is a recommendation, and no ticket state, message send, refund, account action, or customer outcome is claimed.

Required inputs:

- support case
- known facts
- customer impact
- available ownership or escalation path

Expert clarification questions:
- `support case`
  - English: Which support case should we examine first?
  - Korean: 어떤 지원 사례를 먼저 살펴봐야 하나요?

Expected outputs:

- customer-safe reply draft with stated facts, unknowns, and tone
- issue/severity/impact/escalation matrix
- internal next-step and owner handoff brief
- missing repro, account, entitlement, or approval evidence list

Artifact expectations:

- prepared support case brief when a wrapper captures it

Artifact contracts:

This label denotes the machine-enforcement level, not a skill quality score and not an observed evidence state.

- contract_id: `support-operations`; enforcement_level: `guidance_only`; consumer_id: `none`

Safety rules:

- Keep customer-safe facts, unknowns, and escalation recommendations distinct.
- Do not claim ticket mutation, message send, refund, account action, or case outcome.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `ops-review`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill support-operations --harness ops-review --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
