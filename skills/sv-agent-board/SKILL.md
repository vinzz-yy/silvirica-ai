# Agent Board

This is a Silvirica-native `agent-board` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`agent-board` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.
- A multi-lane implementation of an accepted plan is ultrawork, which prepares its durable lanes through this board.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: agent-board coordinate PM, CTO, QA, and release agents on this launch checklist.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_agent_board_card` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: agent-board mark the other agent complete without an observed heartbeat or result.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Choose the coordination from the request: `durable` (restart survival, cross-profile pickup) prepares a `kanban_*` action on the named board; `bounded_research` prepares one `delegate_task` action. Never substitute one route for the other when its surface is missing.
- Call `omh_agent_board` `prepare`, then invoke the returned `native_action` through the normal Hermes tool loop; Silvirica never calls a native tool itself and grants no host permission.
- Report the request state exactly: `prepared`, `unavailable` (named `missing_capabilities`, zero native calls), `denied`, `observed`, or `failed`. A `complete` receipt implies no review approval, CI, or merge; a `running` readback is a claim, not dispatch proof.
- Agent/operator reference: docs/AGENT-BOARD.md; wrapper actions example: examples/agent-board/native-actions.json.

## Recovery Notes

- If `prepare` returns `unavailable`, name the missing capability (tool, schema, hook, host identity, board binding, or native compare-and-swap) and keep the card prepared-only.
- If a receipt is `failed` or `requires_reconciliation`, run an observed `show` on the same task before the next mutation; never retry a `create` automatically. Repeating a `create` with the same `request_id` returns the already observed task.
- No native `kanban_dispatch` tool exists: dispatch stays `unavailable` and an operator claim is the observed path. A positive `request_changes` needs a review-claimed run from the host's own review dispatcher.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.

## Use When

Use when multiple Hermes profiles, agents, or targets need a board-shaped status contract for collaborative work.

    Strong routing signals: `agent-board`, `agent board`, `kanban`, `multi-agent`, `multi agent`, `multi agent board`, `multiple hermes agents`, `multiple hermes profiles`, `hermes profiles`, `subagent`, `subagents`, `sub agent`, `sub agents`, `agent coordination`, `agent task board`, `task board`, `roles and board`, `role board`, `heartbeat`, `blocker`, `agent blocker`, `agent heartbeat`, `agent handoff`, `handoff board`, `interviewer reviewer builder`, `reviewer builder`, `칸반`, `멀티 에이전트`, `서브에이전트`, `서브 에이전트`, `여러 에이전트`, `Hermes agent 여러 명`, `여러 명이 같이 일`, `에이전트 보드`, `작업 배분`, `역할 배분`, `작업 보드`, `역할과 보드`, `역할 보드`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `agent-coordination`
Phase: `board-status`
Hermes role: `tracker`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- agent-board/v1 card or guidance
- agent_board_request/v1 record from the `omh_agent_board` plugin tool
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- agent-board/v1 metadata-only runtime or wrapper card when recorded
- agent_board_state/v1 bounded board snapshot under the Silvirica home: request digests, receipts, and task references only; never raw bodies, comments, attachments, or host identity

Safety rules:

- An agent board card is not proof that another Hermes agent accepted, executed, heartbeat-ed, or completed work unless target-specific evidence exists.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `agent-board`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill agent-board --harness agent-board --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
