# Data Pipelines

This is a Silvirica-native `data-pipelines` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`data-pipelines` exists because pipeline work had no owner: `backend` owns a service's schema migration, `data-analysis` analyzes data it is handed, and `relational-db` owns a database's locks and indexes, while a backfill that duplicated events or a schema change with unknown readers reached memory and event lanes with no idempotency contract or replay bound at all.

## First Steps

- Ask what makes a row unique at the sink before planning any rerun.
- Bound the window and the targets before ordering any replay or backfill step.

## Do Not Use When

- The ask is a service's own database migration, API, or queue design; use `backend`.
- The ask is analyzing, charting, or summarizing a dataset that was handed over; use `data-analysis`.
- The ask is a slow query, an index, or DDL locking a live table; use `relational-db`.
- The ask is remembering or syncing what the assistant knows about the user; use `memory-sync`.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: our airflow etl backfill is producing duplicate events
- Expected behavior: Find the sink's unique key, name the append that duplicated rows, write the idempotency contract (event-id dedupe or partition overwrite), then bound the backfill window and gate it on key uniqueness and row count against the prior window.
- Why: Rerunning an appending backfill doubles the duplicates it was meant to fix.

Bad example:

- Prompt: just delete the duplicates and rerun the whole history
- Expected behavior: Refuse the unbounded rerun: fix the write to be idempotent first, then backfill a bounded window behind a quality gate.
- Why: Deleting duplicates without fixing the write guarantees the next rerun duplicates again.

## Completion Checklist

- The sink's unique key and the idempotency contract are stated.
- Every replay or backfill is bounded by window and target.
- Every downstream reader of a schema change is named with its impact.
- Every load names its data-quality gate and the value that stops it.
- Silvirica ran nothing, and every count cites observed output or is marked unverified.

## Recovery Notes

- If no unique key exists at the sink, the first step is defining one; say so before any rerun.
- If lineage is unavailable, list readers found by search and mark the map incomplete.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Coding handoff** (`idea-to-deploy`, `llm-app-dev`, `cto-loop`, `deploy-and-monitor`, `code-review`, `build-failure-triage`, `verification-gate`, `security-safety-review`, `+28 more`) - coding owners, handoffs, review, CI, and merge evidence.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when a batch or streaming data pipeline needs planning or repair: an ETL, ELT, Airflow, dbt, Spark or Kafka job; a backfill or a replay of past events; duplicate or missing rows; a schema change whose downstream readers are unknown; a lineage question; or a data-quality regression. The output is the lineage, the schema change's downstream impact, an idempotency contract, a bounded replay or backfill plan, and the data-quality gate each load must pass; Silvirica runs no job and reads no warehouse.

    Strong routing signals: `data-pipelines`, `data pipeline`, `data pipelines`, `etl`, `elt`, `etl pipeline`, `etl job`, `etl backfill`, `airflow dag`, `airflow etl`, `airflow backfill`, `dagster`, `dbt model`, `dbt run`, `spark job`, `kafka topic`, `kafka events`, `kafka consumer`, `backfill`, `data backfill`, `replay events`, `replay the events`, `event replay`, `idempotent`, `idempotency`, `exactly once`, `exactly-once`, `duplicate events`, `lineage`, `data lineage`, `data quality`, `data quality check`, `schema evolution`, `late arriving data`, `dead letter queue`, `batch job`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `planning`
Phase: `data-pipelines`
Hermes role: `planner`
Quality tier: `idempotent-replay-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Find what makes a row unique at the sink before proposing any rerun.
- Load `references/pipeline-method.md` for the idempotency patterns, the schema compatibility table, the replay and backfill procedure, and the quality checks instead of recalling them.
- Map lineage from the orchestrator's graph first and mark anything found only by search.
- Treat duplicates as an idempotency defect, not a cleanup task: fix the write, then repair the rows.
- Keep prepared, run, and verified as separate states for every load and check.

Handoff policy:

Keep the lineage map, schema impact, idempotency contract, replay or backfill plan, and quality gates in Hermes. Row counts, job runs, query results and check outcomes are recorded only from executor, operator, or wrapper observed output; Silvirica never runs a pipeline, triggers a backfill, or queries a warehouse.

Required inputs:

- the pipeline: its orchestrator, its sources, its sinks, and its schedule or trigger
- the unit of the problem: the table, topic, or model, and the time window affected
- what makes a row unique at the sink: the natural key, the event id, or the partition
- the downstream readers already known: models, dashboards, exports, services
- observed counts, job logs, or check results for any claim about what was loaded

Expected outputs:

- lineage_map/v1
- schema_change_impact/v1
- idempotency_contract/v1
- replay_backfill_plan/v1
- data_quality_gate/v1

Artifact expectations:

- lineage_map/v1 names each upstream source and each downstream reader of the affected table, topic, or model, from the orchestrator's graph or a lineage record, and marks readers found by search rather than by the graph
- schema_change_impact/v1 classifies the change as additive, widening, or breaking for each downstream reader, and names the reader that breaks and the order that avoids it
- idempotency_contract/v1 names the key that makes a rerun safe -- a natural key upsert, an event-id dedupe window, or a partition overwrite -- and what happens to a row written twice
- replay_backfill_plan/v1 bounds the window, names the target partitions or offsets, pauses or isolates downstream readers, and writes through the idempotency contract so a second run changes nothing
- data_quality_gate/v1 names the observed checks each load must pass before readers see it -- row count against the prior window, key uniqueness, null rate, freshness -- and the value that stops the load

Safety rules:

- Never plan a replay or backfill without an idempotency contract; a rerun that appends is how the duplicates got there.
- Bound every replay and backfill by window and target; an unbounded rerun rewrites history nobody asked about.
- A breaking schema change waits until every downstream reader in the lineage map is adapted or named as accepting the break.
- Do not publish a load to readers before its data-quality gate is observed; a prepared check is not a passed one.
- Silvirica never runs a job, triggers a backfill, or queries a warehouse; every count and check comes from observed output or is marked unverified.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `coding-handling`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill data-pipelines --harness coding-handling --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
