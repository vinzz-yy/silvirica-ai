# Git Repair Method

Load this while planning a conflict resolution, a bisect, a history rewrite, or a restack. Silvirica runs no git command: every command below is one the user or the executor runs, and the plan records only what its output showed.

## 1. Inventory what is pushed, first

| Branch | Local head | Remote head | Match | Others may have fetched |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `feature/x` | `git rev-parse feature/x` | `git rev-parse origin/feature/x` | yes / ahead / behind / diverged | yes when it is shared, has an open PR, or a CI run |

Run `git fetch` before reading the remote column; a stale remote-tracking ref makes every later step wrong. A commit that is on a remote someone else may have fetched is shared history: rewriting it is a decision for everyone who has it.

## 2. Recovery point before every rewrite

- `git branch backup/<name>-<date> <branch>` before a rebase, reset, amend, or filter.
- Or note the reflog entry: `git reflog show <branch> -n 5`, and write down the entry to return to.
- Recovery is `git reset --hard backup/<name>-<date>` or `git reset --hard <branch>@{N}`, and it comes before trying anything else.

## 3. Conflicts

- Read both sides before choosing: `git diff --merge`, or `git log --merge -p -- <file>` for what each side intended.
- Decide each hunk by what both changes were for, not by which side is newer.
- **Generated or counted files are never picked.** Take either side, finish the merge, then re-run the producer and commit its output. A count pinned in two places conflicts whenever both sides added a case, and neither side is right.
- Lockfiles: resolve the manifest, then regenerate the lockfile with the package manager.
- A rebase replays commits one at a time; the same hunk can conflict at every step. `git rerere` records resolutions so the repeats resolve themselves.
- Verify after resolving: the build and the tests that cover the conflicted files, observed.

## 4. Bisect

1. Name a known-good commit and a known-bad commit, each confirmed by one observed run.
2. Name the exact command that tells them apart and exits non-zero on bad.
3. `git bisect start <bad> <good>`, then `git bisect run <command>`; exit code 125 skips an untestable commit.
4. Record the first bad commit and the command's output at it and at its parent.
5. `git bisect reset` to return.

A flaky command bisects to noise. Measure its failure rate first; if it is not 0% on good and 100% on bad, loop it inside the bisect command until it is.

## 5. History rewrite

| Goal | Command | Rewrites |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Squash or reorder before review | `git rebase -i <base>` (or `--autosquash` with `fixup!` commits) | every commit after `<base>` |
| Fix the last commit | `git commit --amend` | the last commit |
| Drop local commits | `git reset --hard <ref>` | the branch pointer |
| Undo a pushed commit without rewriting | `git revert <sha>` | nothing |

Pushing a rewrite: `git push --force-with-lease=<branch>:<expected-sha> origin <branch>`. The lease refuses the push when the remote moved since the inventory, which is exactly the case a bare `--force` would silently destroy. Never force-push a shared default branch; revert there instead.

## 6. Stacked branches

When the base of a stack is rebased or squash-merged, every branch above it still carries the old base commits.

- Record each branch's old base **before** the base moves: `git rev-parse <base-branch>`.
- Restack each branch onto the new head of the one below it: `git rebase --onto <new-base> <old-base> <branch>`.
- Never compute the old base with `git merge-base` after the base was rewritten; it finds a commit the rewrite no longer contains and replays the base's commits onto itself.
- Push each restacked branch with `--force-with-lease`, bottom-up.

## 7. Shared checkouts and worktrees

- Two sessions in one checkout share `HEAD`: a `checkout` by one moves the other's next commit onto the wrong branch. Use one worktree per session.
- Removing a worktree mid-rebase loses the rebase state; finish or abort the rebase first.
- A commit that landed on the wrong branch is moved with `git branch -f` or a cherry-pick plus a reset on the wrong branch, and the other session's branch is repaired with `git update-ref`, never a `reset --hard` inside their checkout.
