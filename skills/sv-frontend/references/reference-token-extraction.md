# Reference Token Extraction

A user-supplied reference is the visual contract. The work is extraction
into `DESIGN.md`, not admiration: a reference that is only glanced at
degrades into a vague mood, the contract inherits none of its precision,
and the output lands back at generic — which is what the gate exists to
stop.

## Static reference (screenshot, mockup, Figma export)

Extract into `DESIGN.md`, naming the reference in the Research Log:

- palette samples per background layer, text level, and accent;
- the type scale as measured ratios (display/heading/body/caption), the
  weights in play, and how line-height behaves;
- layout geometry: container width, column rhythm, section spacing values;
- component anatomy: radii, borders, shadows, and every state treatment the
  reference shows;
- copy tone and density — the real shape of the content, not lorem
  geometry.

## Live URL reference

When the user's selected executor or browser lane can drive a page, extract
runtime truth instead of guessing from pixels: computed styles for tokens,
the actual default/hover/focus/active states, transition durations and
easings, and responsive behavior at the breakpoints that matter. Record
what was extracted in the Research Log. Silvirica itself never launches a
browser, network call, or daemon — extraction happens in the lane the user
selected, and only its recorded findings enter the contract.

## Fidelity discipline

- Extract tokens and layout grammar; never copy logos, trademarks, or
  brand copy.
- Recombine into project-specific primitives — the reference calibrates
  quality; it does not become the product.
- Final QA for reference-driven work goes to the visual-QA owner: request a
  `visual_qa_plan/v1` whose references name the supplied reference, with
  the visual-fidelity review perspective comparing the rendered result
  against it side by side — and verify the implementation is a reusable
  design-system build, not a screenshot-matched one-off.

## Boundary

Extraction produces a prepared contract. Rendered comparisons, screenshots,
and PASS verdicts belong to the visual-QA owner and stay observed-only.

## Attribution

The idea of pairing a design-system contract file with taste-direction
material and an evidence-bound critique lane adapts concepts from the
`frontend` skill of `code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent@9c62b62` (Sustainable Use
License 1.0) and its permissively licensed design upstreams:
`Leonxlnx/taste-skill` (MIT), `nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill` (MIT),
`Owl-Listener/designpowers` (MIT), and `nexu-io/open-design` (Apache-2.0).
No upstream text is reproduced; the wording here is Silvirica's own, and Silvirica keeps
its deterministic no-render boundary. Product names appear as quality
analogies only; Silvirica is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any
named company.
