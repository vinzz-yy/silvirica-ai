# Backend Service Contract

Load this when preparing a server, API, or job surface. The always-loaded skill body states the rules; this is the filling order, the per-stack pointer table, and the failure modes that make a contract look complete while leaving the boundary undefined.

Everything here is prepared guidance. Silvirica starts no server, calls no endpoint, and runs no test. A written contract is not a running service.

## 1. Fill order

Fill in this order, because each step invalidates a guess made earlier out of order.

1. **Callers and trust.** List every caller class and mark it public, partner, internal, or machine. An endpoint whose caller class is unnamed cannot have a correct auth check.
2. **Auth boundary.** Say exactly where an untrusted request becomes a trusted one -- the middleware, the guard, the token exchange -- and which check runs on each path. Authentication (who) and authorization (may they) are two rows, never one.
3. **Resource and operation shape.** Name each endpoint or job, its operation, and whether it is safe, idempotent, or neither. A non-idempotent operation reachable by a retrying client needs an idempotency key, and that key is part of the contract, not an implementation detail.
4. **Response shape.** One success envelope and one error envelope for the whole surface. Per-endpoint improvisation is the most common source of client-side special-casing.
5. **Error paths.** Every failure mode gets a row before the happy path is called done.
6. **Storage.** Only now design tables and indexes; the access patterns are known by this point. Migration order goes in `references/schema-migration.md`.

## 2. The auth boundary map

| Path | Caller class | Authentication | Authorization | Failure mode when it is missing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (one row per endpoint or job) | public / partner / internal / machine | how identity is established | what the identity is allowed to do | what an unauthenticated caller reaches |

Two rules the table exists to force:

- **No implicit internal trust.** "Internal" is a network claim, not an identity. If an internal path has no check, that is a decision to write down, not a default to inherit.
- **Object-level checks are per object, not per route.** A route guard that proves the caller is signed in does not prove the caller owns the row it asked for. List that check separately or it will not be written.

## 3. The error-path table

| Failure mode | Status / code | Body shape | Retryable? | Logged / redacted |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bad input | 4xx validation | error envelope with field paths | no | log shape, never values |
| unauthenticated | 401 | error envelope, no detail | no | log attempt, never the token |
| unauthorized | 403 | error envelope, no resource hint | no | log subject and object |
| not found vs not permitted | pick one deliberately | must not leak existence | no | log the real reason |
| conflict / version mismatch | 409 | current version, expected version | after refetch | log both versions |
| upstream dependency failure | 5xx or 503 | error envelope, retry hint | yes, with backoff | log upstream identity |
| timeout | 504 or 408 | error envelope | yes, bounded | log duration and budget |

The two rows that are always argued about and always matter: **not-found versus not-permitted** must be chosen on purpose, because returning 404 for a forbidden object hides existence and returning 403 confirms it; and **retryable** is a contract promise, because a client that retries a non-idempotent write you marked retryable will double-charge someone.

## 4. Response consistency

- One envelope shape for success, one for errors, across the surface.
- Errors carry a stable machine code alongside the human message. Clients branch on the code; the message is for humans and may be localized.
- Pagination is one style for the whole surface -- cursor or offset, not both -- and the contract names the ordering key. An unstable sort key makes pagination silently lossy.
- Time is one representation. Nullability is explicit. An optional field that is sometimes absent and sometimes `null` is two shapes.
- Versioning: name how a breaking change reaches clients before the first breaking change, not during it.

## 5. Per-stack reference pointers

The stack is a routing input. Name it in the contract and tell the executor which material to read first; do not restate framework documentation here.

| Stack signal | What the executor should load first |
| --- | --- |
| Python service | the framework's own routing, dependency-injection, and validation docs; the project's typed-settings and migration tooling |
| Node / TypeScript service | the framework's routing and middleware docs; the project's schema-validation library and its query builder or ORM |
| Go service | the router and middleware docs in use; the project's query-generation and migration tooling |
| Rust service | the framework's extractor and error-handling docs, plus the `rust` workflow for the ownership and error contract |
| Any stack | this repository's existing handlers -- the nearest sibling endpoint is a stronger convention source than any framework guide |

If the stack is unknown, prepare the contract stack-neutral and name the stack as the one blocking input. A stack-neutral contract is useful; a contract written for the wrong stack is not.

## 6. Failure modes

| Symptom | What actually went wrong | Correction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Endpoints designed, auth "handled by middleware" | The boundary was assumed, never mapped | Fill the auth boundary map before endpoint rows |
| Only the happy path specified | The error table was treated as documentation | The error table is the contract; write it before handoff |
| Every endpoint has its own error body | No response-shape contract existed | One envelope for the surface |
| Tables designed before access patterns | Storage was step one instead of step six | Re-derive the schema from the finished operation list |
| "It works" from a local run | A local run is not integration evidence | Keep integration, load, and deployment as separate observed states |

## Attribution

Concept lineage only. The idea of a mandatory per-language reference gate that
escalates on `unsafe`/FFI contact, and of a hypothesis-first native debugging
loop, is adapted from the `programming` and `debugging` skills of the
`omo-ai` plugin; the DAP-over-printf preference is adapted from `can1357/oh-my-pi`'s
first-class debug adapter tooling. No upstream text is reproduced -- the
wording, the artifact vocabulary, and the `prepared_not_observed` claim
boundary are Silvirica's own, and Silvirica keeps its no-execution boundary: every command
below is something the executor runs, never Silvirica.
