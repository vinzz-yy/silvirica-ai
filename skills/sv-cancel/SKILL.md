# Cancel

This is a Silvirica-native `cancel` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`cancel` exists to keep `operator` work explicit, evidence-backed, and inside the Hermes/executor boundary instead of relying on ad hoc chat narration.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is casual chat, a status-only acknowledgement, or another workflow has stronger routing evidence.
- The user needs implementation, review, CI, merge, or external publishing evidence that has not been delegated or observed.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: cancel: handle a operator request that needs explicit evidence boundaries and a clear stop condition.
- Expected behavior: Run `cancel` only after naming the target, evidence boundary, and stop condition.
- Why: The request matches the catalog use case and keeps observed evidence separate from prepared guidance.

Bad example:

- Prompt: cancel: treat casual chat or unaccepted work as if this workflow already produced verified results.
- Expected behavior: Ask a clarification question or route to a narrower workflow instead of forcing `cancel`.
- Why: The request lacks the required inputs or would overclaim work that Hermes did not observe.

## Completion Checklist

- The local command, managed path, config surface, and state artifact inspected are named.
- Blocking issues, warnings, and optional surfaces are separated.
- The next repair action is explicit and does not claim a reload or runtime observation.

## Recovery Notes

- If a managed path or config key is missing, route to setup/update repair instead of editing hidden state.
- If a reload or plugin load was not observed, keep the diagnostic result as local health evidence only.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use to cleanly end active adapted workflow state.

    Strong routing signals: `cancel`, `$cancel`, `stop the workflow`, `abort the run`, `cancel the loop`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `operator`
Phase: `state-cleanup`
Hermes role: `tracker`
Quality tier: `evidence-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name the workflow target, constraints, validation evidence, and stop condition.
- Separate Hermes guidance from executor or wrapper behavior unless evidence proves the step happened.

Handoff policy:

Run directly in Hermes/runtime state; never delegate cancellation to a coding executor.

Required inputs:

- active workflow state
- cancellation intent

Expected outputs:

- cleared state
- safe stop summary

Artifact expectations:

- state clear record when state exists

Safety rules:

- Do not imply hidden Hermes runtime behavior.
- Use the smallest verification that can prove the claim.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `goal-execution`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill cancel --harness goal-execution --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
