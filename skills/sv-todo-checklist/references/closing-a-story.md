# Closing A Story

The last phase of a code story - `X. Close` in the `code-story` plan
template. Open this when the work is finished and somebody is about to say so.

Closing is two acts, and conflating them is the failure this page exists to
prevent.

**Landing the change happens outside Silvirica.** Silvirica makes no network calls, so it
neither merges anything nor watches anything merge. Whether the change landed
is observed evidence somebody else supplies.

**Reporting the close is what this page governs.** Say what the record says,
and say what the record could not say. A report that does the second well and
lets a reader infer the first has claimed a merge nobody observed.

## The record a close may read

| Source | Held where | Read these | What it supplies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Plan record (`omh_todo/v1` item) | durable record, read with `Silvirica runtime todo show` | `state`, `phase`, `blocked_reason` | what was done, which stage it belonged to, and what was skipped with its reason |
| Verification gate (`verification-gate`) | optional durable model declaration, read with `omh_todo action=recall`; absent unless recorded | `observed_check_results/v1`, `claim_verdict/v1` | command, source, exit status, summary, scope, and freshness for each check that ran, plus which checks are missing or failed |
| Review (`code-review`) | optional durable model declaration, read with `omh_todo action=recall`; absent unless recorded | `ranked findings per axis` | what a reader misses unless someone tells them |
| QA (`ultraqa`) | optional durable model declaration, read with `omh_todo action=recall`; absent unless recorded | `pass/fail evidence` | what nobody thought of the first time |

Read the live plan with `Silvirica runtime todo show`, and the accepted scope checkpoint
with `omh_todo action=recall`. Verification gate, Review and QA can now survive the session as
bounded declarations written with `omh_todo action=record`. No write promotes
a claim to proof: even `claimed_evidence_state=observed` retains
`standing=model_declaration` and `observed=false`.

## Natural continuation, without a second engine

Resolve the person's intent from conversation context, in their language; do
not require a workflow name or finishing keyword. For an accepted three-point
plan, a request such as “Ja, mach alles Besprochene fertig” means those three
accepted points, not every brainstormed idea. Stop or analysis-only instructions
and intervening topic changes outrank an old plan. An unrelated story, modal or
book is not a continuation request merely because the same words occur.

For multi-turn work, declare just the accepted items with `omh_todo action=set`,
then `action=checkpoint`, `accepted=true`, short `rejected` summaries and the
exact revision/worktree and environment fingerprints. This freezes scope; it
does not approve an edit or change `plan_stage`. Read `action=show` before
replacing an existing plan. The code-story template remains optional.

On resume, `action=recall` without an ID lists the current profile/project's
checkpoints. Read the intended ID with current revision/environment. If more
than one could be meant, ask rather than choosing the newest silently. A later
session may explicitly declare that same scope using `action=set`; recall
itself changes no checklist and starts no work. Keep blocked, skipped or
waiting-child obligations open and report the actual reason. Never busy-poll
merely to avoid returning the turn to Hermes.

Before closing, use `omh_todo action=record` for each applicable verification
verdict, review finding set and QA result. Supply `checkpoint_id`, current
`revision` and `environment` fingerprints, and a `result` object containing the
original `item` number, `kind` (`verification`, `review` or `qa`), `verdict`
(`PASS`, `HOLD` or `BLOCK`), short `summary`, explicit `findings`, `claimed_source`,
`claimed_evidence_state` and bounded `references`. Preserve `model`, `host_exit`,
`independent_review` and `ci` provenance separately; none is authenticated by
this declaration. An empty
finding list declares none found, not a missing source. Keep raw outputs outside
the dossier. Read back the exact checkpoint with `action=recall`: missing, stale
and malformed differ from declared clean. The
completion projection covers verification declarations for every accepted item;
review and QA are applicable source records, not mandatory extra phases. A
reported review/QA blocker also prevents declaration completeness. Even complete
declarations remain `not_verified` until the agent checks original evidence.

`verification_receipt/v1` references reuse the existing immutable receipt key,
which binds revision, command, toolchain, environment and claim scope. A stored
key is not a validated receipt: read the original through its existing owner
and check every binding. Native declarations do not manufacture receipts, host
exit observations, independent-review attestations or CI observations.

The dossier is bounded to 32 checkpoints, 64 results per checkpoint and 512 KiB
per Silvirica home. Full stores refuse writes without evicting history. Results older
than 30 days or with different revision/environment are stale. Bindings are
caller-declared revision/environment fingerprints, not host-attested Git state;
never reuse a fingerprint after editing the worktree. Scope and identity are
host-bound; no raw transcripts, logs or environment values belong here.

Offline fixtures prove callable tools, ownership, storage, resume and claim
boundaries. They do not prove that a live model selects this workflow or follows
it for German, typos or a later conversational turn. That needs a separately
authorized model evaluation, not more keyword rules.

## What `done` means here, and what it does not

Three inferences a close report must not make.

**Every item `done` does not mean every item was worked.** It means every item
was DECLARED done, by a writer who may simply not have done it. Silvirica observes
declarations; no record can see the difference, and a close report that reads
`done` as delivery has invented the evidence between them.

**A phase `done` carrying a `blocked_reason` was skipped on purpose.** The
template refuses a stamped plan that DROPS a phase, so a phase this change did
not need is still on the list, marked `done`, with a reason saying why it
produced nothing. Report those as skipped and quote the reason; folding them
into the delivered phases turns the template's one enforceable guarantee into
a longer list of things that look shipped.

**No `blocked_reason` anywhere means nothing was RECORDED as blocked.** It is
not evidence that nothing was blocked. An empty field and an unwritten field
read identically here.

## The report

Five parts. The first and the last are the ones usually missing.

1. **Basis.** Which of these the report rests on, before any content:

   - `entries_observed`
   - `sources_read_no_entries`
   - `session_sources_lost`
   - `plan_record_absent`
   - `unknown_or_missing`

   Only `sources_read_no_entries` is a statement about the change. The rest
   are statements about what could be read, and saying which is the difference
   between a close and a confident silence.

2. **Phase by phase, in the list's own order.** Quote `phase`, `state`, and
   `blocked_reason` rather than paraphrasing them, and do not sort. On an
   ordinary plan `phase` is a free-text label the store never ranks, and an
   item may carry none at all, so stored order is the only order there is. A
   `code-story` plan does have a delivery order -- its labels are
   numbered, and a stamped plan that first names them out of sequence is
   refused -- but stored order already is that order. Reading the list as it
   stands is right either way; re-deriving an order is not.

3. **What was not delivered.** Every item not `done`, plus every `done` item
   carrying a `blocked_reason`. A plan closed with items still open is an
   ordinary outcome and says so; a plan closed by ticking them is not.

4. **Landing, observed or absent.** Name the artifact somebody actually saw -
   a merge commit, a CI conclusion, a pull-request state - and who saw it. A
   prepared handoff is `prepared_not_observed` and is not a landing.

5. **What could not be read, per source.** Read-and-empty and could-not-read
   are different answers, and only the first is about the change.

The record bounds parts 2 and 3 before you start: at most 20 items,
200 characters of text each, and a record written by another session is
unlinked after 24 hours. A close attempted the next day may find no plan at
all, which is `plan_record_absent` and never "nothing was blocked".

## What closing may not do

- **Do not tick the remaining items to finish the list.** A state written at
  close time is a fresh declaration that the outcome happened, and it outlives
  the session in a way the conversation does not. An open item reported as
  open costs a sentence; an open item marked `done` is a false record.
- **Do not issue a verdict here.** PASS, HOLD, and BLOCK over build, lint,
  typecheck, tests, docs and CI belong to `verification-gate`, which runs
  before this phase rather than inside it. A close report restating one of its
  verdicts has not re-proved it.
- **Do not let the deep guide, the ELI5 pass, or the quiz stand in for the
  close.** Those are `wiki`'s three handover artifacts and they are retained
  knowledge, not a report of what the plan says.

## Boundary

A close report is prepared narration over a metadata-only record. It is not
execution, verification, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence, and
issuing one neither lands a change nor makes a declaration into a result.
