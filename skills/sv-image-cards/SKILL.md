# Img Summary

This is a Silvirica-native `img-summary` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`img-summary` exists so Hermes can turn common communication work into provider-neutral image-card prompts while adapting format, domain mood, background, texture, lighting, camera, and poster grammar, and keeping generation, QA, and delivery as observed-only evidence.

## Do Not Use When

- The user needs a deck, PDF, spreadsheet, HWP, Markdown package, or binary file export plan; use `materials-package`.
- The user wants a text-only report, leadership brief, or PPT-ready outline; use `report-package`.
- The user asks Silvirica to directly generate, inspect, upload, or post an image without a wrapper-supplied observed evidence path.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: img-summary make a PR summary card for reviewers.
- Expected behavior: Prepare visual_prompt_card/v1 with the PR review infographic format, copy mode, generation prompt, negative prompt, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The request asks for an image-card communication artifact, not a PDF/deck package or hidden image generation.

Bad example:

- Prompt: img-summary prove this generated card was posted to Slack.
- Expected behavior: Ask for visual_observation/v1 delivery evidence or report delivery as not_observed.
- Why: A prompt card cannot prove generated image, QA, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- The material source, target format, audience, structure, and QA expectation are named.
- Binary export, rendering, formula recalculation, attachment, and delivery stay observed-only.
- The next action identifies whether the package is planned, generated, QA-ready, or blocked.

## Recovery Notes

- If a renderer or file tool is missing, keep the package prepared and expose the generation handoff.
- If render QA is unavailable, mark the artifact unverified and request the smallest visual/file check.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Materials and visual summaries** (`design-orchestration`, `apple-design`, `design-quality-gate`, `award-bar-score`, `frontend`, `accessibility-audit`, `visual-qa`, `content-operator`, `+6 more`) - web, accessibility, visual QA, files, and packages.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should prepare a source-specific visual or supplied-image edit prompt without claiming generation or transformation.

Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `visual-card-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Pick one canonical source kind: meeting, github_pr, issue_feedback, research_briefing, report_summary, or release_announcement.
- Use the source-specific format profile instead of forcing every visual into the same grid.
- Expose the detected `domain_key` so wrappers and users can explain why a domain-specific scene and poster archetype were selected.
- Adapt scene, texture, depth, lighting, camera, motifs, palette, and composition to domains such as security, commerce, sports, fashion, finance, developer work, or research.
- Resolve a poster archetype such as Swiss grid, cinematic key-art, editorial magazine, constructivist photomontage, data infographic, product ad, technical brutalist, museum exhibition, sports event, or luxury lookbook.
- Ask image tools to render the domain-specific environment first, then place readable card modules on top; reject flat vector clipart, plain gradients, generic glass cards, color-swapped templates, and low-detail wallpaper.
- Preserve a stable Silvirica img-summary format contract: source badge, headline, source-kind subtitle, content modules, evidence footer, and small `Silvirica generated` mark.
- Use long_scroll or extended rows when the card needs a document-style vertical canvas with more sections or denser text.
- Keep visible card text readable and faithful to supplied source or structured sections; do not shrink paragraphs into tiny poster copy.
- Separate prompt prepared, image generated, visual QA passed, and delivered states.
- Bind an image result to the card digest, action, attempt, and content digest, then warn on route mismatch, unknown route, stale card, digest drift, and response reuse rather than resolving any of them.
- For transformations, preserve requested identity, composition, text, and protected regions; verify the observed result against the edit brief before a PASS claim.
- Prefer `img-summary` over `materials-package` only when the request asks for an image, visual card, or summary card.
- Use materials/report workflows only after an observed generated file needs packaging.

Handoff policy:

Keep card copy shaping, source-kind selection, language mode, prompt assembly, and evidence narration in Hermes. Use wrapper-reported image generation only as an optional action; record generated image, visual QA, and delivery claims only from visual_observation/v1 evidence.

Required inputs:

- source/image
- create/edit
- format
- ratio
- headline or source text
- audience
- language mode
- card sections, source excerpts, or preserve/remove constraints

Expected outputs:

- visual_prompt_card/v1
- image_generation_setup/v1 when generator capability is missing
- source-specific visual format
- detected domain_key
- domain-aware visual theme
- poster_archetype/v1
- poster archetype visual grammar
- background, texture, camera, and lighting direction
- image-safe card copy
- generation prompt
- image transformation brief when editing a supplied image
- negative prompt
- quality checks
- visual evidence boundary
- visual_generation_receipt/v1 when a producer reports an image attempt
- requested route separate from observed route

Artifact expectations:

- visual_prompt_card/v1 prompt card when prepared
- image_generation_setup/v1 fallback when image_generation_capability/v1 is unknown or prompt_only
- visual_observation/v1 only when a wrapper or user records generated image, visual QA, or delivery evidence
- visual_generation_receipt/v1 only when a producer reports one image attempt, with unattested route fields left unknown

Safety rules:

- Do not call image providers, LLMs, APIs, or network services from Silvirica core.
- Do not claim image generation, visual QA, posting, sharing, attachment, or delivery from a prepared prompt card.
- Require visual_observation/v1 before claiming generated image, visual QA, or delivery evidence.
- Report requested route apart from observed route; leave provider, model, quality, operation, dimensions, and credential class unknown unless visual_generation_receipt/v1 attests them.
- Do not infer an observed provider, model, or quality from configuration, capability state, or a returned file.
- A failed or partial visual_generation_receipt/v1 keeps its failure stage and is not generated-image evidence.
- Raw source text may become only an extractive draft; do not fabricate summaries, owners, decisions, test results, or conclusions.
- Show `generate_visual_image` only when wrapper context reports image_generation_capability/v1 as connected, and still treat it as wrapper-owned action rather than evidence.
- When image_generation_capability/v1 is unknown or prompt_only, ask which image tool to use and route to image_generation_setup/v1 instead of pretending generation can start.
- For image edits, require a supplied image reference and state preserve, remove, replace, crop, and output constraints without claiming the source image was loaded.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `img-summary`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill img-summary --harness img-summary --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
