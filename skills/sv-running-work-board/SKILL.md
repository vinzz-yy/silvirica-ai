# Running Work Board

This is a Silvirica-native `running-work-board` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`running-work-board` exists because multi-session coding work was invisible: the runtime was tracked but the model was dropped, token counts had no write site at all, and a blocking dispatch could not report that it was still running. The board answers which model on which runtime, or says unknown.

## Do Not Use When

- The user wants to start, plan, or dispatch coding work rather than observe it.
- The user wants review, CI, or merge evidence, which a status board never provides.
- The user is asking about their own application's runtime status rather than Silvirica coding units.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: what is running right now
- Expected behavior: One line per unit: label, runtime, model, status, elapsed, tokens, with unknown printed where nothing was observed.
- Why: The request is about observed local coding activity, not about starting work.

Bad example:

- Prompt: is the deploy done and did CI pass
- Expected behavior: Route to verification or CI evidence instead of the activity board.
- Why: Observed activity is not result, review, CI, or merge evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Runtime and model are named per unit, or explicitly reported as unknown.
- Token counts and session references are observed values or the literal unknown, never estimates.
- Elapsed time for an unfinished unit comes from its start marker, which cannot prove the unit is still alive.
- The board is labelled observed activity, not result, verification, review, CI, or merge evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If no units are found, say so plainly rather than implying nothing ever ran.
- If a marker is stale because a process died, report it as observed-start-without-end instead of claiming the unit is running.
- If tokens are unknown for a runtime with no structured output, say the runtime does not report them.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when the user asks what coding work is running right now -- which unit, which runtime, which model, how long, how many tokens -- rather than asking to start, plan, or review work.

    Strong routing signals: `running-work-board`, `running work board`, `which units are running`, `what models are running`, `지금 뭐 돌고 있어`, `뭐가 돌고 있어`, `어떤 모델로 돌고 있어`, `실행 중인 작업 보여줘`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `operator`
Phase: `observability`
Hermes role: `tracker`
Quality tier: `evidence-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name the workflow target, constraints, validation evidence, and stop condition.
- Separate Hermes guidance from executor or wrapper behavior unless evidence proves the step happened.

Handoff policy:

Read local dispatch and progress artifacts directly and render the board; never dispatch or modify a unit from this workflow.

Required inputs:

- local coding artifacts

Expected outputs:

- per-unit runtime and model
- observed tokens and elapsed
- explicit unknowns

Artifact expectations:

- metadata-only status board projection from local artifacts

Safety rules:

- Do not imply hidden Hermes runtime behavior.
- Use the smallest verification that can prove the claim.

## Runtime Evidence

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
