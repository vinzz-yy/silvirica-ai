# Achievements

This is a Silvirica-native `achievements` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`achievements` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: achievements show my unlocked badges and what is closest to the next tier.
- Expected behavior: Produce `show_achievements_summary` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: achievements recompute my session history and grant the missing badges.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- The run or workflow scope, metric window, failure modes, and cost/latency boundary are named.
- Local telemetry, provider truth, billing truth, and completion evidence are separate states.
- Warnings name the next measurement or operator review action.

## Recovery Notes

- If provider metrics are unavailable, report only local metadata and mark provider truth not_observed.
- If cost or latency looks risky, surface a warning plus the next measurement rather than a completion claim.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when the user asks which achievements or badges they unlocked, badge progress or tiers, recent unlocks, or wants an achievements section prepared for a report.

    Strong routing signals: `achievements`, `achievement`, `badges`, `badge`, `my badges`, `show achievements`, `achievement summary`, `unlocked badges`, `badge progress`, `achievement tier`, `recent unlocks`, `badge share card`, `実績`, `バッジ`, `成就`, `徽章`, `업적`, `배지`, `뱃지`, `도전과제`, `업적 요약`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `observability`
Phase: `telemetry-card`
Hermes role: `tracker`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- hermes_achievements_observation/v1 summary or badge list
- recent unlocks and progress hints
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- hermes_achievements_observation/v1 metadata-only payload from `Silvirica achievements` when recorded
- supplied `session_activity_receipt/v1` when available; unavailable metrics stay unavailable, never zero

Safety rules:

- An achievements card reflects only locally observed hermes-achievements plugin artifacts; it is not a session-history rescan, badge recomputation, unlock proof beyond those artifacts, or productivity evidence.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
