# Award Judging Model

The instrument behind "make it award-winning". The rules are CSS Design Awards'
published ones; the score and stack tables are measured from public entry pages
and live sites, sampled 2026-09-03. Re-read both before quoting them, and name
the body and the read date in the artifact. Other award bodies score different
axes on different scales, so never carry these numbers to a different jury.

## The published model

CSSDA scores an entry on three axes:

| Axis | Reported weight | What it measures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI | 40% | Interface design: aesthetics, craft, and effects |
| UX | 30% | Experience and functionality |
| Innovation | 30% | New development and design ideas |

A jury panel scores each entry, and an entry page exposes the per-judge scores
alongside the public per-axis vote averages. Award tiers: **8.0 and above**
takes Website of the Day, **6.0 and above** takes Special Kudos, and the
public awards need a 6.0 judge average plus at least 20 votes. The 40/30/30
split is reported rather than stated in the jury rules, so when the artifact
depends on the ratio, mark it reported and score the axes separately too.

## The bar is a pass mark, not a ranking

Daily winners cluster immediately above the cutoff: most sit between 8.0 and
8.5, and a score above 8.6 is the exception. The distribution is a spike at the
threshold because 8.0 is where the award starts. "Award-winning" therefore
means *cleared 8.0*, not exceptional, and a brief that treats it as exceptional
overbuilds.

## The three axes move together

Nine sampled entries, per-axis public scores:

| Entry | UI | UX | INN | Final | Axis spread |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Why Zero | 8.87 | 8.90 | 8.93 | 8.90 | 0.06 |
| Son Daven | 8.46 | 8.51 | 8.53 | 8.50 | 0.07 |
| MECHA | 8.13 | 8.25 | 7.75 | 8.05 | 0.50 |
| monolayer | 7.77 | 7.63 | 7.73 | 7.71 | 0.14 |
| METRIC. | 7.60 | 7.69 | 7.63 | 7.64 | 0.09 |
| Jeffrey's LAB | 7.56 | 7.60 | 7.66 | 7.60 | 0.10 |
| Inngest | 7.60 | 7.18 | 7.62 | 7.47 | 0.44 |
| Thinkz | 7.16 | 7.39 | 7.31 | 7.28 | 0.23 |
| Royal Green | 6.97 | 6.97 | 6.93 | 6.96 | 0.04 |

The spread between a site's own three axes has a median of 0.10 and a maximum
of 0.50. The spread between sites is 1.94. **Axis spread is roughly a twentieth
of site spread**, so judges rate a site, not three independent properties.

Two rules follow, and they bound how this skill reports:

- Never model a lopsided profile. A UI 8.5 / INN 6.5 site is not in the data;
  a two-point axis gap does not occur. Scoring one axis two points below
  another means the scoring is wrong, not that a rare site was found.
- A weak axis is worth naming only near the threshold. MECHA is the case:
  Innovation 0.50 below UX drags a would-be 8.2 to 8.05. Below 8.0 the axis
  gap is not the problem, because **the whole site is the problem** and moving
  one axis 0.1 changes nothing.

Report the constraint honestly: at 7.3, say the site needs a level change, not
an axis fix. Reserve binding-constraint language for totals inside about 0.3
of the threshold, where a single axis can still decide it.

## What winners actually ship

The same nine sites, measured from their live HTML, CSS, and first-party
bundles:

| Capability | Sites | Read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clamp()` fluid type | 8/9 | Entry fee, not innovation |
| Self-hosted or variable font | 8/9 | Entry fee |
| `mix-blend-mode` | 6/9 | Common craft signal |
| Lenis or GSAP motion | 6/9 | Common, not required |
| `prefers-reduced-motion` | 6/9 | See below |
| Three.js or WebGL | 3/9 | **Not required** |

Two readings the table earns:

- **Fluid type and real typography are the floor.** The one site without
  `clamp()` and the one without a variable or self-hosted face are the bottom
  two scores. These buy no points; their absence costs them.
- **WebGL is not the price of Innovation.** Only a third of the sample ships
  3D at all, and the 8.50 entry scores 8.53 on Innovation with GSAP and
  scroll work alone. A brief that treats WebGL as the requirement is buying
  the most expensive path to an axis that accepts cheaper ones.

## What the innovation axis costs

Of the six sites shipping a motion library, **three respect
`prefers-reduced-motion` and three do not**. So the tradeoff is real at the
cutoff: some entries do buy Innovation by dropping the media query.

The two highest-scoring entries both ship heavy motion *and* respect it. That
is the pattern worth copying — the accessible path is not the lower-scoring
path, and the sites that skipped the query did not out-score the ones that
kept it.

The budgets stay authoritative. When an innovation move breaks one:

- Record it in `tradeoff_ledger/v1`: the move, the axis point it buys, the
  budget or success criterion it costs, and the mitigation if one exists.
- Let the user choose. Chasing a score past a WCAG criterion or a Core Web
  Vitals budget is a decision the brief records, never a default this skill
  takes.
- Prefer the move that buys the axis point without the cost: motion behind
  `prefers-reduced-motion`, a native control styled rather than rebuilt, a
  scene that degrades to a static poster. `Silvirica-accessibility-audit` and
  `Silvirica-frontend/references/web-vitals-budgets.md` own those budgets.

## Boundary

Scoring a surface against a published rubric is a self-assessment. A jury
scores submissions; Silvirica does not, and no score prepared here predicts a
placement, a selection, or an award. Axis scores require rendered evidence —
the visual-QA owner produces it, and an unrendered page keeps every axis
`not_observed`. The stack table is a nine-site sample read on one date, not a
survey; treat a single row as an example and never as a rule.
