# Prompt Import Readiness

This is a Silvirica-native `prompt-import-readiness` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`prompt-import-readiness` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: prompt-import-readiness review Codex and Claude Code prompt folders before exposing them as Hermes slash commands with $ARGUMENTS mapping.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_prompt_import_readiness` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: prompt-import-readiness silently import every external prompt, overwrite slash commands, and claim the prompts are trusted without review.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Prompt sources, agent family, expected file formats, argument syntax, slash-command names, trust level, and stop condition are explicit.
- Explicit-path audit reads and compatibility results are observed only in their audit output; source discovery, command registration, prompt mutation, slash-command activation, and dry-run execution remain marked not_observed.
- Route broad candidate discovery to skill-scout, prompt/tool safety to security-safety-review, missing CLIs or directories to toolbelt-readiness, and approved implementation to a selected executor handoff.
- Imported prompts, generated command files, registry updates, and dry-run results are reported only from observed prompt-import evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If source prompt directories are unknown, route to workspace-audit or skill-scout before readiness scoring.
- If source trust, prompt-injection risk, secrets, or destructive command content is unclear, route to security-safety-review before import.
- If the user asks to actually copy, generate, or register prompt files, prepare an executor or workspace-file handoff and keep readiness prepared_not_observed until file evidence exists.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use before importing, normalizing, or exposing external prompt files as Hermes slash commands so source trust, formats, argument interpolation, name collisions, review status, and dry-run evidence stay explicit.

    Strong routing signals: `prompt-import-readiness`, `prompt import readiness`, `slash prompt import`, `slash prompts import`, `slash command prompt import`, `prompt library import`, `prompt folder import`, `prompt directory import`, `import CLI prompts`, `import agent prompts`, `CLI agent prompt files`, `OpenCode prompt import`, `Claude Code prompt import`, `Codex prompt import`, `codex prompt import`, `Gemini CLI prompt import`, `frontmatter prompt import`, `prompt compatibility audit`, `explicit prompt file audit`, `argument interpolation`, `$ARGUMENTS mapping`, `{{args}} mapping`, `$1-$9 prompt arguments`, `prompt slash command collision`, `Hermes slash prompts`, `슬래시 프롬프트 가져오기`, `프롬프트 가져오기`, `프롬프트 디렉터리 가져오기`, `프롬프트 폴더 가져오기`, `슬래시 명령 프롬프트`, `프롬프트 인자 매핑`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `prompt`
Phase: `prompt-import-readiness`
Hermes role: `guide`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- prompt_import_readiness_card/v1
- prompt_compatibility_audit/v1 for explicitly named local files
- prompt_source_inventory/v1
- prompt_format_matrix/v1
- argument_interpolation_policy/v1
- slash_command_collision_report/v1
- prompt_trust_review/v1
- prompt_import_manifest/v1 when observed
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- prompt_import_readiness_card/v1 metadata-only wrapper card when prepared
- prompt_compatibility_audit/v1 with bounded source metadata, format classification, argument syntax, collisions, and review reasons for explicitly named local files
- prompt_source_inventory/v1 with source directory, agent family, file count, format claim, and review state
- prompt_format_matrix/v1 separating YAML frontmatter, TOML frontmatter, raw markdown/text, and unsupported formats
- argument_interpolation_policy/v1 for $ARGUMENTS, $1-$9, {{args}}, named placeholders, escaping, and missing argument handling
- slash_command_collision_report/v1 with command names, aliases, existing Hermes commands, and conflict resolution policy
- prompt_trust_review/v1 with source trust, prompt-injection risk, secret leakage risk, license/source notes, and review owner
- prompt_import_manifest/v1 only when file reads, parsed prompts, generated slash-command candidates, or dry-run output are observed

Safety rules:

- An explicit-path prompt compatibility audit observes only bounded local file classification and metadata. It is not source-directory discovery, prompt import, slash command registration, prompt mutation, command activation, imported prompt trust, or successful dry-run evidence.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `prompt-import-readiness`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill prompt-import-readiness --harness prompt-import-readiness --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
