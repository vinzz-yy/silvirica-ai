# Data Analysis

This is a Silvirica-native `data-analysis` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`data-analysis` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: data-analysis analyze this CSV and summarize anomalies by segment.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_data_analysis_card` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: data-analysis invent trends from an unavailable spreadsheet.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Dataset or corpus source, record scope, schema or extraction method, join assumptions, analysis question, method, and stop condition are explicit.
- Numeric claims, anomalies, trends, segments, and log patterns are reported only from observed data or supplied evidence.
- Causal claims require observed identification evidence.
- Source acquisition, file conversion, report generation, and code fixes are routed to the narrower workflow when stronger.

## Recovery Notes

- If the data itself is missing, ask for the smallest dataset sample, schema, or query output needed.
- If the user wants datasets found online, route to source-finder before analysis.
- If the user wants a PPT/PDF/XLSX report generated from data, route to materials-package or deliverable-package after analysis scope is clear.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Research and company ops** (`product-docs`, `source-finder`, `web-research`, `research`, `model-optimization`, `inference-serving`, `model-finetuning`, `research-brief`, `+20 more`) - research, signals, ops, and briefings.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should prepare supplied structured, unstructured, or mixed data analysis without unsupported numeric or causal claims.

    Strong routing signals: `data-analysis`, `data analysis`, `dataset analysis`, `csv analysis`, `json analysis`, `log analysis`, `table analysis`, `analyze csv`, `analyze this csv`, `analyze json`, `analyze logs`, `summarize anomalies`, `anomaly analysis`, `trend analysis`, `segment analysis`, `column analysis`, `schema check`, `table to chart`, `chart with an executive summary`, `spreadsheet delta analysis`, `cohort analysis`, `retention analysis`, `correlation analysis`, `causal analysis`, `causality check`, `데이터 분석`, `csv 분석`, `json 분석`, `로그 분석`, `이상치 분석`, `추세 분석`, `오류 패턴`, `컬럼 분석`, `전환율 델타`, `차트 요약`, `상관관계 분석`, `인과 분석`, `인과관계`

Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- data_analysis_task_card/v1
- dataset_scope/v1
- analysis_method_plan/v1
- operations_data_harness/v1
- product_evidence_loop/v1
- analysis_result_summary/v1 when observed
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- data_analysis_task_card/v1 metadata-only wrapper card when prepared
- dataset_scope/v1 with source, row/record scope, columns or schema, filters, and stop condition
- analysis_method_plan/v1 naming summary, anomaly, trend, segment, schema, or log-pattern methods
- operations_data_harness/v1 for relationship and causal boundaries
- product_evidence_loop/v1 for prepared opaque data reference metadata
- analysis_result_summary/v1 only from observed data, calculations, query output, or supplied evidence

Safety rules:

- A data analysis card is not file extraction, query execution, chart generation, statistical proof, data correctness, hallucination-safe numeric evidence, association, or causality unless observed data and method evidence records it.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `data-analysis`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill data-analysis --harness data-analysis --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
