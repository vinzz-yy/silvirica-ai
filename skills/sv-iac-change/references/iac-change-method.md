# IaC Change Method

Load this while planning an infrastructure-as-code change. Silvirica prepares; the operator or the executor runs every command, and each step is `prepared` until its output is observed.

## 1. Per tool

| Tool | Drift | Saved plan or diff | Health gate | Rollback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Terraform / OpenTofu | `plan -refresh-only` | `plan -out=tfplan`, then `show tfplan` | a follow-up `plan` reports no changes, plus the service's own signal | revert the commit and apply the prior configuration; a destroyed resource does not come back |
| Pulumi | `pulumi refresh --preview-only` | `pulumi preview --diff` | `pulumi preview` shows no changes | revert and `pulumi up` the prior program |
| CloudFormation | drift detection on the stack | a change set, reviewed before execution | stack reaches `UPDATE_COMPLETE` | automatic rollback on failure, or a new change set to the prior template |
| Kubernetes / kustomize | `kubectl diff` against the live objects | `kubectl diff -f` or `kustomize build` output | `kubectl rollout status` within a stated timeout | `kubectl rollout undo` for a workload; re-apply the prior manifest otherwise |
| Helm | `helm diff upgrade` (plugin) or `helm get manifest` | `helm diff upgrade` or `helm template` | `--wait` with a timeout, then the release's own probes | `helm rollback <release> <revision>` |

## 2. Reading the blast radius

- Count creates, in-place updates, replacements and destroys from the saved plan, not from the code diff.
- A replacement (`-/+`, "must be replaced", `replace` in a change set) destroys and recreates: a database, a volume, a bucket, an address, or anything with an identity other resources reference is a blocker for explicit approval.
- A renamed resource with no `moved` block or import is a destroy and a create.
- List what depends on each replaced or destroyed resource: DNS, security groups, IAM bindings, persistent volume claims.

## 3. Drift before the change

Resolve drift first, one resource at a time: import it, move it, re-declare it, or revert the manual change. Record which. An apply over unresolved drift silently reverts someone's hotfix or re-creates something deliberately removed.

## 4. Cost delta

Estimate against the saved plan (Infracost or the provider's calculator) and record the monthly delta with the resources that drive it. When no estimate was run, write `unestimated` and name those resources; a missing estimate is not a zero.

## 5. Staged apply

| Stage | Promotes on | Stops on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lowest environment | its health gate observed | any gate failure; roll back that stage |
| each next environment | the previous stage's gate and its own | a gate failure, or a plan that differs from the reviewed one |
| production | every earlier gate, and explicit approval for any stateful replacement | as above |

Re-plan per environment and apply the saved plan for that environment. A stage without a health gate or a rollback is not a stage.
