# Source Finder

This is a Silvirica-native `source-finder` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`source-finder` exists so Hermes can turn vague source discovery requests into typed candidates, acquisition status, and downstream workflow choice without pretending Silvirica searched, downloaded, or verified the material.

## Do Not Use When

- The requested output is factual findings, comparison, or a summary rather than a typed candidate inventory and acquisition status; use `research`.
- The user needs a business decision brief with evidence-versus-inference treatment; use `research-brief`.
- The user asks for current citations, fact-finding, or source-backed synthesis; use `research`.
- The user supplies a paper/PDF/arXiv/DOI/excerpt and wants explanation; use `paper-learning`.
- The user asks for recurring monitoring, source inbox, or Scout/Analyst/Briefer operations; use `research-department`.
- The user asks to export, convert, render, package, or attach a file; use `materials-package` or `deliverable-package`.
- The user asks for an image card or visual summary; use `img-summary`.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: source-finder find papers, datasets, and GitHub repos for evaluating browser agent benchmarks.
- Expected behavior: Prepare source_finder_plan/v1 with typed candidates, acquisition states, missing observed evidence, and downstream choices.
- Why: The user needs source candidates before deciding whether to learn, research, package, or implement.

Bad example:

- Prompt: source-finder find current citations and summarize what the sources say.
- Expected behavior: Route to `research` because the user asks for current evidence and synthesis, not candidate acquisition status.
- Why: Source-finder prepares acquisition lifecycle metadata; research owns current evidence synthesis.

## Completion Checklist

- Source kinds, source boundaries, and downstream intent are named.
- Each candidate has a source_candidate/v1 shape and acquisition state.
- Observed states include provenance before being treated as evidence.
- The next downstream workflow is recommended without claiming it ran.
- Search, download, clone, extraction, hash, license, verification, and downstream processing gaps are explicit.

## Recovery Notes

- If the user asks for facts or citations, route to `research`.
- If a candidate lacks a link or file reference, keep it candidate_prepared and ask for the next observable source step.
- If the user wants to process a selected source, route to the downstream workflow instead of continuing source acquisition.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Research and company ops** (`product-docs`, `source-finder`, `web-research`, `research`, `model-optimization`, `inference-serving`, `model-finetuning`, `research-brief`, `+20 more`) - research, signals, ops, and briefings.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when the requested output is a typed source candidate inventory and acquisition status across papers, web links, datasets, GitHub repositories, public presentations, docs/specs, or unknown source material before choosing paper-learning, research, research-brief, research-department, materials-package, or an ultrawork delivery cycle.

    Strong routing signals: `source-finder`, `source finder`, `source acquisition`, `source intake`, `find papers and datasets`, `find datasets and repos`, `find papers`, `find arxiv link`, `find arxiv paper`, `find datasets`, `find github repos`, `find oss repos`, `find presentations`, `find public slides`, `find docs and specs`, `find source candidates`, `download candidate`, `source candidate`, `acquisition status`, `자료 후보`, `출처 후보`, `arxiv 링크`, `arxiv 링크 찾아`, `논문 데이터셋 찾아`, `깃허브 저장소 찾아`, `공개 발표자료 찾아`, `문서 스펙 찾아`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `research`
Phase: `source-acquisition`
Hermes role: `researcher`
Quality tier: `source-acquisition-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name source kinds from: paper, web_link, dataset, github_repo, presentation, docs_spec, unknown.
- Record acquisition state from: candidate_prepared, link_observed, download_link_prepared, download_observed, file_hash_recorded, text_extraction_observed, license_checked, verification_observed, downstream_selected.
- Separate candidate preparation, observed link, observed download, file hash, text extraction, license check, verification, and downstream selection.
- Attach observation provenance before treating any acquisition state as evidence.
- Vary search angles across official docs, academic work, implementations, datasets, and criticism until each requested source kind has candidates or another angle change adds nothing new.
- Recommend the next downstream workflow without pretending that downstream work already ran.

Handoff policy:

Keep source acquisition planning in Hermes. Do not claim search, download, clone, extraction, license check, verification, or downstream processing unless a wrapper or user records observed evidence.

Required inputs:

- source target or topic
- desired source kinds
- source boundaries or exclusion criteria
- downstream intent when known

Expected outputs:

- source_finder_plan/v1
- source_candidate/v1
- source_candidate_set/v1
- source_acquisition_status/v1
- downstream workflow recommendation
- not-evidence boundary

Artifact expectations:

- source_finder_plan/v1 under .Silvirica/source-finder when a wrapper or CLI records it

Safety rules:

- Do not claim web search, download, repository clone, file extraction, file hash verification, license verification, or source correctness from a prepared candidate.
- Do not redefine research-department's source_inbox/v1; source-finder owns source_candidate_set/v1 and source_acquisition_status/v1 only.
- Route current citations and source-backed synthesis to `research`, supplied-paper explanation to `paper-learning`, recurring monitoring to `research-department`, file export to `materials-package`, and image cards to `img-summary`.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `source-finder`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill source-finder --harness source-finder --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
