# Silvirica Docs

Use this skill to answer questions about Silvirica itself from current sources. It
defaults to passive inspection; it is not a generic documentation writer,
workflow picker, or settings workflow.

## Default Behavior

1. Classify the question as a public-product fact, a current-local-install
   fact, or both. Keep those claim sets separate in the answer.
2. Retrieve only the sources needed for the question. Current public facts must
   come from official `rlaope/silvirica-ai` sources; current local facts must
   come from passive CLI output, or narrowly scoped non-secret metadata. If a
   diagnostic command records state, disclose that side effect before running it.
3. Disclose the source URL or command/path and the relevant ref, version, or
   commit. If freshness cannot be established or official sources conflict,
   name that boundary.
4. Answer the one-shot question directly. Do not create a durable artifact
   unless the user requests one.

For a public catalog count, inspect the generated catalog on the current
official ref. For an installed count, run `Silvirica list --json` and count only that
installation manifest. Never quote a remembered or embedded count.

## Source Route

For public/product questions, start with live GitHub repository metadata and
the current default branch, then read the relevant current source. Load
`references/product-and-sources.md` for the full official-source hierarchy,
product identity, conflict handling, and disclosure shape.

For current capability and public skill-name questions, load
`references/capability-map.md`. It covers the six public capability families,
representative exact skill names, catalog retrieval, and the public ULW labels.

For model routing or this machine's installation, load
`references/model-routing-and-local-state.md`. It separates published routing
behavior from passive local inspection, the state-writing `Silvirica doctor --json`
diagnostic, and safe inspection of the resolved Silvirica home (`~/.Silvirica` by default,
but overridable).

For retained knowledge or memory questions, load
`references/long-term-memory.md`. It distinguishes reviewed Silvirica project memory
from Hermes private long-term memory and points to `docs/MEMORY.md` and
`docs/MEMORY_CONTEXT.md`.

## Public Product vs Local Install

- Public-product facts describe the current official repository at a disclosed
  branch, tag, version, or commit. A local checkout does not silently replace
  that source.
- Local-install facts describe only the inspected machine/profile at a
  disclosed Silvirica version or commit. Documented paths can be absent because
  install profiles and enabled features differ.
- When both matter, report them under separate labels before explaining any
  difference.

## Safety and Mutation Boundary

Never read or print credentials, tokens, auth files, `.env` values, provider
secrets, raw private logs, or unrelated user content. Do not broaden a metadata
question into a home-directory scan.

If the user asks to set up, install, update, repair, change settings, edit
memory, or modify code, name the appropriate specialized public workflow such
as `Silvirica-doctor`, `Silvirica-skill`, `Silvirica-model-setup`, or `Silvirica-memory-sync`, then stop
before mutation unless that separate action is authorized.

## Answer Contract

- Lead with the answer, then the public-product and local-install evidence that
  supports it.
- When both scopes matter, label the evidence `public_product` and
  `current_local_install` before explaining differences.
- Cite the exact official source or disclosed local observation used.
- State version, branch, tag, or commit and the retrieval boundary.
- Name missing or conflicting evidence instead of filling it from recall.
- Mention execution/review status boundaries only when the question actually
  asks about status; they are not the center of this documentation skill.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Research and company ops**. Stay read-only and return to the
  router when the request belongs to another workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules:
  `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Completion Checklist

- Answer only from disclosed current sources or bounded local observations.
- Treat wrapper metadata-only memory comparisons as advisory local context,
  not proof of Hermes-memory mutation or raw-entry exposure.
- Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or
  `not_observed`.
- Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, or merge evidence.
- Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming
  completion.
- Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.
- Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available:
  native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

## Recovery Notes

- If official retrieval fails, disclose the gap and use only versioned fallback
  evidence.
- If local metadata is absent, report that scoped absence without expanding
  into private content or mutation.
