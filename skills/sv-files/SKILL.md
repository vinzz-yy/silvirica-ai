# Workspace File Operator

This is a Silvirica-native `workspace-file-operator` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`workspace-file-operator` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: workspace-file-operator list files in the reports folder and move old PDFs into archive after confirmation.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_workspace_file_operator_card` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: workspace-file-operator delete every matching file without path scope or confirmation.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- The path root, allowed file operations, excluded paths, destructive-operation policy, and stop condition are explicit.
- Delete, overwrite, move, rename, permission change, archive mutation, upload, and download are gated or marked missing.
- Directory listings, file contents, hashes, diffs, and operation results are reported only from observed file evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If the target path or folder is missing, ask for the smallest path scope needed before preparing the operation.
- If delete, overwrite, move, rename, chmod, or irreversible cleanup is requested, require an explicit confirmation gate.
- If the request is file conversion, deck/PDF export, or attachment delivery, route to materials-package or deliverable-package instead.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should prepare or supervise local workspace/file-system operations such as listing, searching, organizing, copying, moving, renaming, archiving, or deleting files without claiming the operation ran.

    Strong routing signals: `workspace-file-operator`, `workspace file operator`, `file operator`, `file operation`, `file operations`, `filesystem task`, `filesystem operation`, `file system task`, `file system operation`, `list files`, `list folder`, `list directory`, `find local files`, `search files`, `organize files`, `organize folder`, `move file`, `move files`, `copy file`, `copy files`, `rename file`, `rename files`, `delete file`, `delete files`, `remove file`, `remove files`, `archive files`, `downloads folder`, `reports folder`, `folder cleanup`, `file cleanup`, `파일 작업`, `파일 조작`, `파일 정리`, `파일 검색`, `파일 찾아`, `파일 이동`, `파일 복사`, `파일 이름 변경`, `파일 삭제`, `폴더 정리`, `다운로드 폴더`, `디렉터리 목록`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `filesystem`
Phase: `file-task`
Hermes role: `guide`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- workspace_file_task_card/v1
- file_operation_scope/v1
- file_observation_manifest/v1 when observed
- file_confirmation_gate/v1 when destructive
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- workspace_file_task_card/v1 metadata-only wrapper card when prepared
- file_operation_scope/v1 with path root, allowed operations, excluded paths, and stop condition
- file_observation_manifest/v1 only when directory listings, file stats, hashes, diffs, or operation output are observed
- session_file_activity/v1 (`Silvirica quality-evidence file-activity --hermes-session <id> --json`) cited in that manifest for which workspace files a Hermes session's read_file, write_file, and patch calls named and the outcome Hermes recorded; never as file-content, hash, diff, test, review, CI, or merge evidence
- file_confirmation_gate/v1 for delete, overwrite, move, rename, chmod, archive mutation, or irreversible cleanup

Safety rules:

- A workspace file operator card is not file read, file write, copy, move, rename, delete, archive, upload, download, permission change, or destructive filesystem evidence unless observed file-operation output records it.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `workspace-file-operator`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill workspace-file-operator --harness workspace-file-operator --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
