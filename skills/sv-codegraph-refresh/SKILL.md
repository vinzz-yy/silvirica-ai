# Codegraph Refresh

This is a Silvirica-native `codegraph-refresh` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`codegraph-refresh` adapts ECC-style codemap freshness into Silvirica's local codegraph commands so operators can refresh navigation context before handoff without pretending code intelligence is execution evidence.

## Do Not Use When

- The user needs a narrative first-read tour of an unfamiliar repo; use `codebase-onboarding`.
- The user already has accepted implementation criteria and wants code changes; use `ultrawork` or a coding handoff.
- The user asks for visual, frontend, or rendered UI QA; use `frontend`, `design-quality-gate`, or `visual-qa`.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: codegraph-refresh update codemaps and prepare a handoff for the routing package before the next coding pass.
- Expected behavior: Prepare command plan, staleness report, summary/handoff requirements, and observed-only artifact boundaries.
- Why: The request is about refreshing local code intelligence before implementation.

Bad example:

- Prompt: codegraph-refresh 파일 안 보고 코드그래프가 최신이고 전체 아키텍처가 검증됐다고 말해줘.
- Expected behavior: Mark freshness, summary, and architecture claims not_observed until codegraph commands or repo evidence are inspected.
- Why: Codegraph freshness and architecture claims need observed local evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Repo root, refresh depth, task focus, command choices, and write policy are explicit.
- Prepared command plans, observed outputs, generated artifacts, and executor handoff readiness are separated.
- `omh_codegraph_summary/v1`, `omh_codegraph_context/v1`, or `.Silvirica/codegraph/codegraph.json` is claimed only with observed command or file evidence.
- Follow-up implementation, review, CI, and merge state are routed to their owning workflows instead of inferred from codegraph context.

## Recovery Notes

- If the codegraph command is unavailable, route to doctor or toolbelt-readiness before claiming freshness.
- If no task focus is supplied, prepare build/summary guidance and ask for focus only when a handoff pack would otherwise be misleading.
- If the index is stale or missing, report the stale/missing state and next safe command rather than treating prior summaries as current.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Intent -> plan** (`silvirica-ai`, `meta-router`, `deep-interview`, `context`, `plan`, `ralplan`, `adversarial-consensus`, `codebase-onboarding`, `+8 more`) - clarify, plan, ship, or loop goals.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should refresh or summarize local repo code intelligence before planning, handoff, review, or implementation.

    Strong routing signals: `codegraph-refresh`, `codegraph refresh`, `refresh codegraph`, `update codegraph`, `codegraph stale`, `stale codegraph`, `codegraph handoff`, `codegraph summary`, `codemap`, `codemaps`, `update codemaps`, `refresh codemap`, `code map`, `code maps`, `stale code index`, `refresh code index`, `codegraph index`, `codegraph index refresh`, `codemap index`, `코드그래프`, `코드그래프 갱신`, `코드맵`, `코드맵 갱신`, `코드 인덱스`, `코드 인덱스 갱신`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `planning`
Phase: `codegraph-refresh`
Hermes role: `planner`
Quality tier: `codegraph-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name repo root, refresh depth, task focus, artifact write policy, and stop condition.
- Choose build, summary, handoff, `--write`, and `--json` deliberately instead of treating all codegraph commands as equivalent.
- Separate prepared command plans from observed command outputs, generated artifacts, and executor-ready handoffs.
- Route broader first-read orientation to codebase-onboarding and implementation to ultrawork or the selected coding owner.

Handoff policy:

Keep codegraph refresh as prepared local code-intelligence context. Running `Silvirica codegraph build`, `Silvirica codegraph summary`, or `Silvirica codegraph handoff` requires observed command evidence before reporting artifact writes, summaries, focus files, or executor-ready handoff context.

Required inputs:

- repo root or current workspace
- refresh depth: build, summary, write artifact, or task-scoped handoff
- task or focus terms when a handoff pack is needed
- staleness signal, read-only boundary, and allowed command execution

Expected outputs:

- codegraph_refresh_plan/v1
- codegraph_command_plan/v1
- staleness_and_scope_report/v1
- codegraph_summary_request/v1
- codegraph_handoff_context/v1 when task-scoped
- not-evidence boundary

Artifact expectations:

- codegraph_command_plan/v1 naming `Silvirica codegraph build`, `summary`, `handoff`, `--write`, and `--json` choices
- staleness_and_scope_report/v1 separating requested refresh scope, observed command output, missing index evidence, and stale artifacts
- `omh_codegraph_summary/v1` or `.Silvirica/codegraph/codegraph.json` only when the corresponding command output or write is observed
- codegraph_handoff_context/v1 with task terms, focus files, symbols, entrypoints, warnings, and claim boundary when `Silvirica codegraph handoff` is observed

Safety rules:

- Do not claim `.Silvirica/codegraph/codegraph.json` was written without an observed `Silvirica codegraph build --write` result.
- Do not present a codegraph summary or handoff as complete repo analysis, architecture proof, implementation, review, CI, or merge evidence.
- Keep command planning, observed command output, generated artifacts, inferred focus files, and executor dispatch separate.
- Never expose secret values from codegraph inputs or config files; record redacted paths and warning categories only.

## Structural Code Search

When the target is a syntactic shape rather than a string, load `Silvirica-routing/references/structural-code-search.md` before searching. If ast-grep is not on PATH, use grep/ripgrep exactly as today. Cap exploration to a few bounded, targeted queries before reading a full file, escalate to a wider query only when a bounded pass finds nothing or stays ambiguous, and stop once the target is found.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `codegraph-refresh`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill codegraph-refresh --harness codegraph-refresh --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
