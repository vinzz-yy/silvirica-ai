# Ai Slop Cleaner

This is a Silvirica-native `ai-slop-cleaner` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`ai-slop-cleaner` exists to keep `maintenance` work explicit, evidence-backed, and inside the Hermes/executor boundary instead of relying on ad hoc chat narration.

## Do Not Use When

- The goal is new or changed behavior rather than removing existing code; a plain refactor, feature, or fix request belongs to `ultrawork`.
- The cleanup would change architecture or module boundaries and needs its execution shaped into phases first; use `refactor-plan`, or `ralplan` when the direction itself is still contested.
- The user wants existing code judged rather than changed; use `code-review` for a bug-first review and `failure-signal-audit` for swallowed failures.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: $ai-slop-cleaner remove duplicated router branches and lock behavior with regression tests before refactoring.
- Expected behavior: Plan cleanup, preserve behavior, delete or simplify code, and prove it with targeted tests.
- Why: The request is maintenance cleanup with regression risk.

Bad example:

- Prompt: ai-slop-cleaner: treat casual chat or unaccepted work as if this workflow already produced verified results.
- Expected behavior: Ask a clarification question or route to a narrower workflow instead of forcing `ai-slop-cleaner`.
- Why: The request lacks the required inputs or would overclaim work that Hermes did not observe.

## Completion Checklist

- The selected coding or runtime owner is named before any implementation claim.
- Prepared handoff, dispatch, execution, verification, review, CI, and merge states are separated.
- The final status cites observed runtime evidence or keeps the work prepared_not_observed.
- When Hermes is the selected coding owner, use `hermes_coding_harness/v1` to keep builder, verifier, reviewer, docs, and PR lanes separate.
- Report the current harness stage, owner, next action, and missing evidence without claiming PR creation, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge until matching runtime observations exist.

## Recovery Notes

- If the selected executor is unavailable, ask for Codex, Claude Code, Hermes, or another runtime before retrying.
- If dispatch or result evidence is missing, keep the handoff prepared_not_observed and expose the next observable action.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Coding handoff** (`idea-to-deploy`, `llm-app-dev`, `cto-loop`, `deploy-and-monitor`, `code-review`, `build-failure-triage`, `verification-gate`, `security-safety-review`, `+28 more`) - coding owners, handoffs, review, CI, and merge evidence.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when the goal is removing existing low-quality, duplicated, or AI-generated code and the observable behavior must not change; lock behavior with tests before and after the edits.

    Strong routing signals: `ai-slop-cleaner`, `$ai-slop-cleaner`, `cleanup`, `deslop`, `refactor`, `risky`, `behavior-preserving refactor`, `risk analysis`, `refactor workflow`, `legacy refactor`, `리팩터링`, `리팩토링`, `위험 분석`, `변경 범위 제한`, `회귀 테스트`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `maintenance`
Phase: `cleanup`
Hermes role: `handoff-guide`
Quality tier: `regression-gated`
Reasoning demand: `heavy`

Quality bar:

- Lock current behavior with regression checks before non-trivial cleanup.
- Classify before deleting: every finding names one category from the slop taxonomy - duplication, dead code, needless abstraction, boundary violation, missing tests, or templated defaults - so the pass order below can own it.
- Run single-smell passes in fixed order, re-verifying between passes and never bundling categories: dead-code deletion, then duplicate removal, then naming and error handling, then test reinforcement; the full contract is `Silvirica-ai-slop-cleaner/references/cleanup-passes.md`.
- When the user names no target smell, run detection first and hand back the inventory: prepared linter and dead-code commands are named per stack in the reference and stay prepared_not_observed until run.
- When the cleanup target is written English rather than code, load `Silvirica-ai-slop-cleaner/references/prose-lexicon.md` for the word tiers, the pattern severities, and the context profile that decides which rules apply.
- Prefer deletion, reuse, and boundary repair over new abstractions.
- Rerun verification after cleanup before claiming behavior is preserved, and close with the four-part report: changed files, simplifications, behavior lock, remaining risks.

Handoff policy:

Use Hermes to define cleanup scope and regression checks; route behavior-preserving edits to the selected coding runtime once tests are clear.

Executor readiness:

- When accepted work mutates code, check `executor_readiness/v1` for the selected Codex, Claude Code, Hermes, or oh-my runtime path before first dispatch.
- If readiness is `missing` or `blocked`, ask the user to choose another coding agent, configure PATH, continue in Hermes, or keep a prompt/runtime handoff; retry only after that state changes.
- A readiness probe is not dispatch, implementation, verification, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.

Delegation transparency:

- When delegating, show the composed delegate prompt in a fenced code block in the status message; truncate a long prompt to a bounded preview ending with `... [truncated, N chars total]` — the user must see WHAT was asked, not just that something was.
- Name every delegated or parallel lane's model and, when the host exposes it, its reasoning effort inline as `(model effort)` in status and briefing lines — including runtime-native subagents; when no effort is exposed, show the model alone as `(model)` rather than writing a placeholder like `unknown` beside a known model, and never emit empty parentheses. Carry token and elapsed figures the same way in these narration lines: report observed figures and omit unobserved ones — when the user asks for a figure directly, say it was not observed instead of omitting it; a rendered status-board column keeps its own `unknown` cell.
- Capture a resumable session or thread id at dispatch and report it in the status message: for non-interactive Claude Code pass `--output-format json` and read `session_id` from the result (resume with `claude -p --resume <session-id>`); for Codex pass `--json` and read `thread_id` (resume with `codex exec resume <thread-id>`, repeating `--skip-git-repo-check` outside a git repo). Never leave a delegate run with no recorded way to resume or steer it — a plain-text one-shot that hides its session id strands the work when the run stalls or times out.
- Before dispatch, grant the executor session every permission the task will need — file write/edit, command/test execution, and the working directory — on the dispatch command itself, not through settings-file guesses: for non-interactive Claude Code pass `--permission-mode acceptEdits` or an explicit `--allowedTools` list (`--dangerously-skip-permissions` only inside an isolated worktree or sandbox), and the equivalent sandbox/approval flags for other CLIs. `acceptEdits: true` is not a settings key and `~/.claude/settings.local.json` is not a file Claude Code reads — user scope is `~/.claude/settings.json` and project scope is `<dispatch cwd>/.claude/settings.local.json` with rules under `permissions.allow`. Prove the grant with a bounded scratch-edit probe run before the real dispatch: a permission denial in a non-interactive run recurs identically on retry, so never redispatch until a changed grant is proven, and surface an ungrantable permission as a blocker before dispatch, not after minutes of silence.

Required inputs:

- target smell, or a scoped file list when the user has not named one
- current behavior
- regression checks

Expected outputs:

- smell inventory naming each finding's category before any edit
- small cleanup diff, one pass at a time
- before/after verification
- closing report: changed files, simplifications, behavior lock, remaining risks

Artifact expectations:

- cleanup plan and regression evidence for non-trivial work

Safety rules:

- Lock behavior with tests before risky cleanup.
- Prefer deletion and existing utilities over new layers.
- Do not add dependencies for cleanup unless explicitly requested.
- A scoped file list is a boundary: never widen it silently; out-of-scope findings are reported, not edited.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `coding-handling`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill ai-slop-cleaner --harness coding-handling --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- When wrapper metadata includes `memory_review_card/v1` or `handoff_context_pack/v1`, treat it as reviewed Silvirica-local or wrapper-supplied context only. Use conflict-free context summaries to shape plans and handoffs, but do not claim Hermes internal memory was read or changed.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
