# Hermes Native Buzz Gateway Setup

Use this lane to connect or repair a Hermes gateway that should participate as
a native agent in a Buzz community. Hermes owns the adapter; do not build a
second transport in Silvirica.

## Inputs

- The target Hermes home/profile.
- The Buzz community relay URL.
- A dedicated agent identity that is already admitted to the community.
- The intended access policy: owner-only, allowlist, or open.
- An observable verification target: inbound message, outbound message, or
  both.

Do not ask the user to paste a private key into chat. A private key belongs in
the target Hermes `.env`; non-secret gateway settings belong in Hermes config.

## Safe Setup

1. Read the current official Hermes Buzz guide and the stable Buzz release
   notes when they conflict with this reference.
2. Check whether `hermes` and the configured Buzz CLI executable exist.
   Presence is installation evidence, not relay readiness.
3. Confirm that the agent identity is separate from the human owner identity
   and is already a member of the target community.
4. Prefer `hermes gateway setup` and select Buzz. Use direct config editing
   only when the guided setup cannot express the accepted configuration.
5. Keep `BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY` in the Hermes `.env`. Never put it in argv, logs,
   diagnostic output, workflow artifacts, or version-control.
6. Configure the relay URL, agent display name, optional channel/DM scope,
   transport mode, and access policy. Do not silently broaden `allow_from`.
7. Start or restart the Hermes gateway only when the user asked for execution.

## Read-only Diagnosis

Observe these independently:

| Stage | Passing evidence |
|---|---|
| configuration | Buzz is enabled and required non-secret fields are present |
| executable | the exact configured CLI path resolves and reports a version |
| identity | a public identity can be derived without printing the private key |
| membership | the agent identity is admitted to the intended community |
| transport | Hermes reports WebSocket or polling activity for Buzz |
| inbound | a new addressed event reaches Hermes without history replay |
| outbound | the send receipt has `accepted=true` and a non-empty event id |

Report missing or inaccessible evidence as `not_observed`; do not turn it into
success. Keep raw relay URLs, account identifiers, channel ids, event ids, and
filesystem paths out of reusable workflow artifacts unless the user explicitly
requests an operator-local artifact.

## Recovery

- Authentication failure: separate key format, relay membership, NIP-42, and
  owner-attestation evidence before changing configuration.
- No inbound messages: distinguish connection state, channel scope, mention
  policy, DM discovery, and self-echo/de-duplication behavior.
- Outbound ambiguity: do not auto-retry when the relay may have accepted an
  event but the response was lost.
- CLI absent: stop at installation guidance; never claim gateway readiness.
