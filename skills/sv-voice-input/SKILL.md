# Voice Operator

This is a Silvirica-native `voice-operator` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`voice-operator` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: voice-operator 'release before lunch, check risky parts' from mobile.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_voice_operator_card` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: voice-operator assume the user approved a destructive action from a vague voice note.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- The short-input or voice-like request is clarified enough to avoid accidental action.
- The next action is readable, reversible when possible, and confirmation-gated when risky.
- Delivery, notification, or platform behavior is not claimed without wrapper evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If transcript confidence or intent is weak, ask one short clarification before action.
- If platform delivery is unavailable, keep the response in chat and mark delivery not_observed.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.

## Use When

Use when Hermes receives terse voice/mobile-style requests and should produce concise clarification, plan, or status UX.

    Strong routing signals: `voice-operator`, `voice operator`, `voice-first`, `voice command`, `mobile command`, `short command`, `dictated command`, `dictated request`, `spoken request`, `speech command`, `accessibility`, `hands free`, `hands-free`, `phone command`, `phone request`, `push command`, `음성`, `음성으로`, `음성 명령`, `모바일 명령`, `모바일 음성`, `핸드폰`, `폰으로`, `말로`, `말로 한 요청`, `접근성`, `짧은 명령`, `짧게 말한 요청`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `accessibility`
Phase: `voice-routing`
Hermes role: `guide`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- voice-operator/v1 card or guidance
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- voice-operator/v1 metadata-only runtime or wrapper card when recorded

Safety rules:

- A voice operator card is not speech recognition, mobile notification delivery, platform action, or accepted execution evidence.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.
- This card is not realtime voice connector readiness. It may read the tool-safety verdict of a supplied realtime_voice_trial_receipt/v1 when one exists, and it never creates, infers, or upgrades one; route realtime voice adoption to external-connector-readiness.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `voice-operator`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill voice-operator --harness voice-operator --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
