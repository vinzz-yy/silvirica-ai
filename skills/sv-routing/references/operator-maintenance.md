# Silvirica Operator Maintenance

Short Silvirica maintenance commands are operator commands, not workflow or coding requests.

## Top Priority Guard

Exact or near-exact requests such as `Silvirica update`, `Silvirica setup`, `Silvirica doctor`, `Silvirica uninstall`, `Silvirica install`, `Silvirica list`, `Silvirica 업데이트해줘`, `Silvirica 닥터 돌려줘`, `Silvirica 삭제해줘`, and `Silvirica 셋업해줘` route as `operator_maintenance_command` with task type `omh_cli_maintenance`.

They outrank stale coding context, router-design feedback, runtime portability, migration, and workflow implementation signals unless the user explicitly asks for code changes.

## Semantics

- `route_level`: `operator_maintenance_command`
- `not_a_workflow`: `coding_handoff`, `router_design_feedback`, `runtime_portability`, `migration`, `workflow_implementation`
- `operation_primitives`: `run_requested_command`, `optional_health_check`, `report_observed_output`, `avoid_repo_mutation`
- `risk_domains`: `stale_context_inheritance`, `over_execution`, `unrequested_repo_mutation`

## Wrapper Copy

Say: "I will run the Silvirica maintenance update path; code changes require a separate request." Adapt `update` to the requested command.

## Evidence Boundary

The requested command output and optional doctor status can become observed evidence. Future Hermes reload, plugin runtime use, coding work, review, CI, and repository mutation stay unobserved unless separately verified.

## Human Summary Vs JSON

Maintenance commands should prefer compact human summaries for chat/operator flows. Full `--json` output remains available for wrappers, automation, and tests that need machine-readable state.
