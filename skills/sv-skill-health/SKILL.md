# Skill Health

This is a Silvirica-native `skill-health` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`skill-health` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks Silvirica to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: skill-health show the Silvirica skill portfolio dashboard with stale surfaces, failure patterns, pending amendments, and top improvement actions.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_skill_health` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: skill-health claim every skill is working and patch the failures automatically without observed signals or review.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared Silvirica guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Dashboard scope, source surfaces, stale/duplicate criteria, and stop condition are explicit.
- Install/setup health is routed to doctor; catalog operations are routed to skill; failure retrospectives are routed to workflow-learning.
- No skill, prompt, doc, memory, or model behavior is claimed changed until a reviewed implementation records evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If the request is about Silvirica setup, install, stale package paths, or command availability, route to doctor.
- If the request is a missed-route or self-improvement trace, route to workflow-learning before adding health actions.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when operators need portfolio-level skill health without treating it as install repair, live execution success, or automatic skill mutation.

    Strong routing signals: `skill-health`, `skill health`, `skill portfolio health`, `skill dashboard`, `skill health dashboard`, `skill failure pattern dashboard`, `skill failure patterns`, `pending skill amendments`, `skill amendments`, `스킬 헬스`, `스킬 상태`, `스킬 대시보드`, `스킬 실패 패턴`, `스킬 개선 후보`, `스킬 보류 수정`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `operations`
Phase: `skill-health`
Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- catalog, generated, reference, harness, and capability-surface status
- observed failure signals, or an explicit statement that none were supplied
- pending amendment review slots and top safe actions with owner lane and verification path

Artifact expectations:

- skill_health_card/v1 metadata-only wrapper card recording surface status, observed-only failure signals, pending amendments, and the non-mutation boundary

Safety rules:

- A skill health dashboard is not install/setup health, live skill execution success, automatic skill mutation, model training, verification, review, CI, or proof that future routing is fixed.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `skill-health`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill skill-health --harness skill-health --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
