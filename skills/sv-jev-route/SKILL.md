# Jev Route

Required: an undecidable route's `route_question` block and the user's message. Output: Jev's pick as a clarification and a recorded answer.

Read `Silvirica-routing/references/jev-rail.md` before the first ask: consent, what leaves the machine, limits, and non-answer statuses. Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution or approval. Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

Contract: `references/full-contract.md`.

## Procedure

1. Confirm the route carries `route_question` and the ladder lists `omh_jev_ask`; tell the user their message leaves the machine.
2. Call `omh_jev_ask` with the block unchanged as `route_question` and the message as `state`.
3. Offer Jev's top pick to the user as a question; the block's thresholds only shape the wording.
4. Record it with `omh_route_answer`, `answered_by: omh_jev_ask`, and the returned `ask_id`.

## Completion Checklist

- Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; load the full contract before claiming completion.
- Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.
- Report the tool's status, ask_id, served model, and cost source; a non-answer is reported as its status and is never an answer.
- Record observed delegation results; use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

## Recovery Notes

- Tool missing, `consent_not_observed`, or refused: follow the rail's recovery section; never simulate an answer.
