# Websearch Setup

This is a Silvirica-native `websearch-setup` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`websearch-setup` exists to make web search cost and routing configurable through two clearly separated, diff-approved steps instead of one opaque edit.

## Do Not Use When

- The user wants Hermes to run a web search now, not configure how web search is set up.
- No scraper key or auxiliary extract-model intent has been named yet.
- The request needs a repository code change rather than a local `.env` or routing edit.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: make web search cheaper — I have a scraper account I want to use, and I want an auxiliary model handling extraction.
- Expected behavior: Diagnose the current `.env` and routing state, guide the scraper API key setup as one diff approval, then the auxiliary web-extract model routing as a second, separate diff approval.
- Why: The request needs the two independently-approved writes this skill exists to keep separate.

Bad example:

- Prompt: websearch-setup: search the web for the latest news.
- Expected behavior: Run or route to the search request directly instead of starting a setup walkthrough.
- Why: A live search request is not a configuration request.

## Completion Checklist

- If a prerequisite is unmet, mark that item "not applicable" and continue with the rest of the guide instead of blocking or guessing.
- Success is applicable-only: verification passes when every applicable item is confirmed complete, not when every possible item exists.
- The scraper API key write and the auxiliary web-extract model write were verified as two separate, independently-approved changes.

## Recovery Notes

- If the scraper provider prerequisite is unmet, mark that step "not applicable" and continue with the auxiliary model routing step alone.
- If either diff is rejected, keep the other step's state independent and do not roll both back together.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `live-incident-response`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `github-issue-intake`, `buzz`, `+39 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.

## Use When

Use when the user wants to reduce web search cost or configure web search by setting up a scraper API key or an auxiliary web-extract model routing block, following the shared prerequisite-check, diagnose, guide, diff-approved apply, and verify contract.

    Strong routing signals: `websearch-setup`, `web search setup`, `make web search cheaper`, `set up web search`, `configure web search`, `reduce web search cost`, `connect scraper api key`, `set up auxiliary web-extract model`, `웹 검색 싸게 만들어줘`, `웹 검색 설정`, `웹서치 설정`, `웹 검색 비용 줄이기`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `hermes-setup`
Phase: `setup`
Hermes role: `guide`
Quality tier: `hermes-setup-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Prerequisite check: confirm required access; mark unmet prerequisites "not applicable" and skip them.
- Read-only diagnose: inspect non-secret config metadata, `.env` key names and presence only, and version; no secret reads or writes.
- Guide: use Silvirica-native secure entry or user-side OAuth/token setup, never chat secrets.
- Diff-approved apply: show the config or `.env` diff with redacted placeholders; apply only after the user explicitly approves.
- Verify: confirm applicable items using non-secret metadata, never secret values.
- Show the scraper API key diff as one diff approval and the auxiliary web-extract model routing diff as a second, separate diff approval; never merge them.

Handoff policy:

Run diagnosis and guidance directly in Hermes for web search setup. Diagnosis reads non-secret metadata only; no writes. Show redacted placeholders in the config or `.env` diff; apply only after the user explicitly approves. Never ask the user to paste secrets into chat. Use Silvirica-native secure entry or user-side OAuth/token setup; if unavailable, stop credential application and guide user-side setup. Use only a user-authorized credential store or local configuration; disclose destination and scope first. Keep secrets out of chat, previews, logs and evidence. Do not promise chat or platform non-retention. Delegate to a selected coding executor only if the user needs a change outside chat-driven config or `.env` edits.

Required inputs:

- scraper API key availability; value through secure entry or user-side setup only
- target auxiliary web-extract model role slot

Expected outputs:

- read-only diagnosis of the current scraper `.env` key and auxiliary web-extract model routing state
- a diff-approved `.env` write adding the scraper API key, approved on its own
- a diff-approved routing block change assigning the auxiliary web-extract model, approved separately from the key write
- verification checklist confirming both writes were applied

Artifact expectations:

- setup verification note when the wrapper captures it

Safety rules:

- Never combine the scraper API key `.env` write and the auxiliary web-extract model routing write into a single apply step; each gets its own diff and its own approval.
- Do not name a specific scraper product, extract-model provider, or price; ask the user which provider they hold an account with and read the current config instead of assuming one.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `hermes-setup`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill websearch-setup --harness hermes-setup --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
