# Curriculum Design

This is a Silvirica-native `curriculum-design` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`curriculum-design` makes outcomes, sequence, assessment, and constraints reviewable before materials or LMS work.

## Do Not Use When

- The user wants an explanation of a supplied academic paper rather than a teachable sequence; use `paper-learning`.
- The user needs a deck, workbook, PDF, or other exported learning artifact; route packaging to `materials-package` after the curriculum is accepted.
- The user asks to create or publish an LMS course, enroll students, grade work, or change course settings; use `connector-operator` with explicit authorization and observed evidence.
- The user needs only a short rewrite or one isolated worksheet prompt, not curriculum structure; use `content-operator`.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: Design a six-week onboarding curriculum with learning objectives and practical assessments for new support agents.
- Expected behavior: Prepare learner constraints, scope and sequence, learning objectives, assessments, and adaptation questions.
- Why: The request needs a teachable sequence and assessment plan rather than an LMS course or exported material.

Bad example:

- Prompt: Explain the attached machine-learning paper for a beginner.
- Expected behavior: Route to `paper-learning`, not `curriculum-design`.
- Why: A supplied paper explanation is not a curriculum-design request.

## Completion Checklist

- The plan names goals, non-goals, assumptions, acceptance criteria, and verification shape.
- Draft recommendations, accepted decisions, and executor handoffs are separate states.
- Rejected options or unresolved tradeoffs are recorded before handoff.

## Recovery Notes

- If acceptance criteria or verification are missing, route back to clarification before handoff.
- If assumptions materially affect the plan, keep them visible and avoid treating the plan as accepted.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Research and company ops** (`product-docs`, `source-finder`, `web-research`, `research`, `model-optimization`, `inference-serving`, `model-finetuning`, `research-brief`, `+20 more`) - research, signals, ops, and briefings.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when an educator or enablement owner needs outcomes, scope and sequence, lesson/module design, assessment criteria, and differentiation assumptions.

    Strong routing signals: `curriculum design`, `learning objectives`, `assessment plan`, `커리큘럼 설계`, `학습 목표`, `평가 계획`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `planning`
Phase: `curriculum-design`
Hermes role: `planner`
Quality tier: `planning-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Tie outcomes to scope, sequence, activities, assessments, and completion evidence.
- Keep instructional design distinct from exported materials or LMS actions.

Handoff policy:

Keep domain framing, clarification, source/evidence synthesis, draft outputs, and next-work routing in Hermes. A prepared brief, review, reply, or plan is not an external action, approval, filing, send, publish, data mutation, implementation, review, CI, or merge claim. Prepare a connector, file, coding, or human-review handoff only when the user explicitly accepts that next step; report it only from observed evidence. Hermes designs an instructional plan; it does not create an LMS course, enroll learners, grade submissions, certify learning, publish materials, or claim learning outcomes occurred.

Required inputs:

- learners
- learning goal
- prerequisites
- constraints

Expert clarification questions:
- `learners`
  - English: Which learner roles or ages and setting, baseline evidence, experience, motivations, language or culture, access needs, and relevant variability should shape the design?
  - Korean: 어떤 학습자 역할 또는 연령과 환경, 기초 수준 근거, 경험, 동기, 언어와 문화, 접근 요구, 관련 다양성이 설계에 반영되어야 하나요?

Expected outputs:

- curriculum_learner_outcome_brief/v1
- curriculum_alignment_map/v1
- curriculum_sequence_design/v1
- curriculum_validation_disposition/v1

Artifact expectations:

- prepared curriculum design brief when a wrapper captures it

Safety rules:

- Make learner prerequisites, accessibility, adaptation, and source-rights gaps explicit.
- Do not claim LMS mutation, enrollment, grading, certification, publication, or learning outcomes.

Procedure: load `references/procedure.md`.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `planning`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill curriculum-design --harness planning --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
