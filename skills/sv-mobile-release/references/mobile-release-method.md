# Mobile Release Method

Load this while planning a store release. Silvirica prepares; the operator or CI builds, signs, uploads and submits, and each step is `prepared` until the store console or crash reporting shows it. Store rules change: confirm limits and dates in the current App Store Connect and Play Console documentation before quoting them.

## 1. Per-platform gates

| Gate | iOS (App Store) | Android (Google Play) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| signing | distribution certificate and App Store provisioning profile, each with an expiry; an App Store Connect API key for CI | an upload key in a keystore; with Play App Signing, Google holds the app signing key and a lost upload key can be reset |
| privacy | `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`: declared data types, tracking domains, and a reason for every required-reason API; third-party SDKs on Apple's list ship their own manifest | the Data safety form in Play Console, covering what every bundled SDK collects and shares |
| beta | TestFlight: internal testers without review; external groups need Beta App Review for the first build of a version; builds expire | testing tracks: internal, closed, open; each promotes to the next or to production |
| rollout | phased release of automatic updates over seven days, pausable; a manual download still gets the new build | staged rollout by percentage, raised step by step, haltable |
| no rollback | a released build stays installed; ship a higher build number, optionally with an expedited review request | a released `versionCode` stays installed; ship a higher `versionCode`, even when it is the old code rebuilt |

## 2. Before submitting

1. Every signing asset: its expiry, where it is held, and who can use it. A secret never enters the plan.
2. The SDK list the build actually ships, compared against the privacy manifest and the Data safety form.
3. The version string and the build number (`CFBundleVersion`, `versionCode`), and the next one reserved for a hotfix.
4. The beta group or track, its testers, and the checks they must pass.

## 3. Rollout halt thresholds

| Signal | Source | Halts the step when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| crash-free users or sessions | crash reporting or the store console | below a stated floor, or below the previous version |
| ANR rate (Android) | Play Console Android vitals | above a stated ceiling |
| store rating or review volume | the store console | a stated drop within the step |
| a business metric the release touches | analytics | a stated drop against the previous version |

## 4. Hotfix

1. Halt or pause the rollout, so no new users receive the bad build.
2. Contain it server-side first when a feature flag or kill switch exists.
3. Build the fix with the reserved higher build number, run the shortest beta that proves it, and submit; on iOS decide whether to request an expedited review.
4. Roll the fix out in stages behind the same halt thresholds.
