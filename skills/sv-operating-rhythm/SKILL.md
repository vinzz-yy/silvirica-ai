# Operating Rhythm

This is a Silvirica-native `operating-rhythm` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`operating-rhythm` exists so recurring operating work has durable minutes, decisions, and follow-up history without pretending a meeting outcome was observed.

## Do Not Use When

- The user only needs a one-off meeting agenda before the meeting; use `meeting-brief`.
- The request is a weekly status/risk summary rather than cadence history; use `ops-review`.
- The user asks for report packaging, PPT outline, or reliability evidence review.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: operating-rhythm 회의록 히스토리 관리하고 스크럼 스프린트 회고를 정리해줘.
- Expected behavior: Create a prepared operating record with cadence, decisions, action items, and not-evidence markers for missing observed notes.
- Why: The request is about recurring operating history, not a generic agenda or code handoff.

Bad example:

- Prompt: operating-rhythm implement the action items from the retro.
- Expected behavior: Route implementation to a plan or selected executor/runtime handoff after action items are accepted.
- Why: Operating records can capture follow-ups, but implementation is a separate observed work stream.

## Completion Checklist

- Confirm the workflow target, evidence boundary, and stop condition are named.
- Report which outputs are prepared, observed, blocked, or missing.
- Name the smallest next verification or handoff instead of claiming completion from narration.

## Recovery Notes

- If required context is missing, ask one blocking question or route back to the narrower workflow.
- If runtime or wrapper evidence is unavailable, keep the status as not_observed and expose the next observable action.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Research and company ops** (`product-docs`, `source-finder`, `web-research`, `research`, `model-optimization`, `inference-serving`, `model-finetuning`, `research-brief`, `+20 more`) - research, signals, ops, and briefings.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should prepare or maintain recurring operating records such as meetings, scrums, sprint plans, retrospectives, decisions, and follow-ups.

    Strong routing signals: `operating-rhythm`, `operating rhythm`, `meeting minutes`, `meeting history`, `scrum record`, `sprint planning`, `sprint review`, `sprint retrospective`, `retro history`, `decision log`, `action item history`, `회의록 관리`, `회의 히스토리`, `운영 리듬`, `스크럼`, `스프린트 회고`, `결정 기록`, `액션 아이템`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `operations`
Phase: `rhythm-history`
Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `operations-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name cadence, audience, time window, known notes, and missing evidence before producing a record.
- Separate agenda/templates from observed minutes, decisions, and action items.
- Record follow-up ownership only when supplied or explicitly mark it unknown.

Handoff policy:

Keep cadence records, minutes scaffolds, decisions, and follow-up history in Hermes; delegate implementation only from separately accepted action items.

Required inputs:

- cadence or meeting type
- audience or participants
- time window
- source notes or explicit missing-notes boundary

Expected outputs:

- operation artifact
- decision log
- action item history
- observed/prepared boundary

Artifact expectations:

- operation_artifact/v1 under .Silvirica/operations when a wrapper or CLI records it

Safety rules:

- Do not treat a prepared record as proof that the meeting or scrum happened.
- Do not mark decisions or action items accepted without supplied notes or owner acknowledgement.
- Keep implementation follow-ups separate from operating history.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `operating-rhythm`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill operating-rhythm --harness operating-rhythm --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `Silvirica-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
