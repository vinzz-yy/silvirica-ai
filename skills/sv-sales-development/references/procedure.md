## Procedure

Declared checks:
- `sales_account_evidence_check`
  - Required result fields: `fit_disqualifiers`, `offer_use_case`, `account_stage_owner`, `stakeholder_states`, `problem_current_approach_impact`, `source_locator_date_reliability_permission`, `contradictions`, `unknowns`, `claim_evidence_state`
  - Criterion: Every account, stakeholder, problem, impact and personalization claim must point to approved supplied or observed evidence or remain a hypothesis; never fill missing customer facts.
- `sales_qualification_state_check`
  - Required result fields: `stakeholder_authority_state`, `problem_current_state`, `measurable_impact`, `decision_criteria_process`, `alternatives`, `timing_urgency`, `risks_blockers`, `champion_economic_buyer_hypotheses`, `prioritized_questions`, `buyer_confirmation_evidence`, `disposition`
  - Criterion: Maintain framework-neutral observed, asserted, hypothesis, unknown and buyer-confirmed states, prioritized questions, and explicit ADVANCE, HOLD or DISQUALIFY evidence criteria; named methods are optional mappings only.
- `sales_sequence_eligibility_check`
  - Required result fields: `consent_basis`, `privacy_constraints`, `suppression_status`, `channel_eligibility`, `policy_constraints`, `audience_persona`, `timing_cadence`, `evidence_backed_personalization`, `approved_proof`, `purpose_value_cta`, `objection_hypothesis`, `validation_question`, `owner_approver`, `stop_opt_out_reply_conditions`, `draft_status`
  - Criterion: HOLD drafting when supplied consent, privacy, suppression, channel or policy eligibility is unknown; each eligible row must remain a draft with bounded cadence and stop, opt-out and reply conditions.
- `sales_handoff_check`
  - Required result fields: `proposed_confirmed_status`, `action`, `owner`, `approver`, `target_timing`, `success_exit_criterion`, `dependencies`, `evidence_refs`, `crm_object_field_value_proposals`, `unresolved_gaps`, `disposition`
  - Criterion: Emit measurable proposed handoff and CRM field/value changes without mutation; only observed buyer response may mark a next step, objection or commitment confirmed.

### `sales_scope_account_evidence` (analysis)

Record fit and disqualifiers, offer and stage, owner, evidenced stakeholders, problem and current approach signals, source provenance and permissions, contradictions, unknowns, and per-claim evidence state.

- Input refs: `account or segment`, `available evidence`, `buyer hypothesis`, `sales objective`
- Output refs: `sales_opportunity_evidence_record/v1`
- Check IDs: `sales_account_evidence_check`

### `sales_build_qualification_state` (analysis)

Build neutral qualification fields, distinguish seller hypotheses from observed buyer responses, prioritize discovery questions, and assign ADVANCE, HOLD or DISQUALIFY criteria without forcing a named method.

- Input refs: `account or segment`, `available evidence`, `buyer hypothesis`, `sales objective`
- Output refs: `sales_qualification_state/v1`
- Check IDs: `sales_qualification_state_check`

### `sales_check_sequence_eligibility` (validation)

Verify supplied consent basis, privacy and suppression restrictions, permitted channels, organizational policy, sender and approver, locale, timing and cadence before any message construction.

- Input refs: `account or segment`, `available evidence`, `sales objective`
- Output refs: `sales_draft_sequence/v1`
- Check IDs: `sales_sequence_eligibility_check`

### `sales_prepare_draft_sequence` (production)

Prepare eligible draft rows for audience, channel, cadence, supported personalization and proof, purpose, value, CTA, objection hypothesis and validation question, owner, approver and stop conditions; do not send.

- Input refs: `account or segment`, `available evidence`, `buyer hypothesis`, `sales objective`
- Output refs: `sales_draft_sequence/v1`
- Check IDs: `sales_account_evidence_check`, `sales_sequence_eligibility_check`

### `sales_validate_handoff` (validation)

Return proposed versus confirmed actions, ownership, timing, exit criteria, dependencies, evidence refs, CRM object/field/value proposals, gaps and ADVANCE, HOLD or DISQUALIFY disposition, preserving confirmation only from observed response.

- Input refs: `account or segment`, `available evidence`, `buyer hypothesis`, `sales objective`
- Output refs: `sales_handoff_disposition/v1`
- Check IDs: `sales_account_evidence_check`, `sales_qualification_state_check`, `sales_sequence_eligibility_check`, `sales_handoff_check`
