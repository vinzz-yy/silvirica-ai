# Sales Development

This is a Silvirica-native `sales-development` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`sales-development` prepares evidence-bounded discovery and qualification guidance without claiming sales execution.

## Do Not Use When

- The user needs a company-level positioning, market-entry, or strategic-options decision rather than account-level discovery; use `strategy-brief`.
- The user supplies a CRM export or pipeline snapshot and needs portfolio health, aging, slipped deals, forecast calibration, or renewal-risk review; use `sales-pipeline-review`.
- The user only wants a polished social post, newsletter, or one-off outbound-copy rewrite; use `content-operator`.
- The user asks to send outreach, update Salesforce or HubSpot, create an opportunity, or book a meeting; use `connector-operator` with explicit recipient, object, and authority.
- The request asks for current competitor or company evidence but supplies no source material; begin with `research` before presenting claims as observed.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: Build a discovery plan and qualification questions for a mid-market prospect considering our support platform.
- Expected behavior: Prepare account evidence gaps, discovery and qualification questions, value hypotheses, and an owned next-step plan.
- Why: The request is account-level sales discovery, not outreach execution or company strategy.

Bad example:

- Prompt: Write a LinkedIn launch post for our new feature.
- Expected behavior: Route to `content-operator`, not `sales-development`.
- Why: A one-off social post has no account qualification or discovery objective.

## Completion Checklist

- The decision, options, tradeoffs, assumptions, and rejected alternatives are named.
- Observed signals are separated from strategic inference.
- Accepted decisions and implementation follow-ups are not conflated.

## Recovery Notes

- If evidence is mostly assumption, label it and recommend a research or feedback-triage pass.
- If the decision owner is missing, keep the output as options rather than accepted strategy.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Research and company ops** (`product-docs`, `source-finder`, `web-research`, `research`, `model-optimization`, `inference-serving`, `model-finetuning`, `research-brief`, `+20 more`) - research, signals, ops, and briefings.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `silvirica-ai` or name the adjacent workflow.

## Use When

Use when a seller or business-development owner needs account context, buyer hypotheses, qualification questions, value narrative, partner/outreach plan, and a non-executing next-step sequence.

    Strong routing signals: `sales discovery`, `account plan`, `outbound messaging`, `영업 발굴`, `고객사 계획`, `아웃바운드 메시지`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `strategy`
Phase: `sales-development`
Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `decision-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Separate account evidence, buyer hypotheses, qualification questions, and next-step ownership.
- Keep outreach drafts and CRM actions explicitly non-executing.

Handoff policy:

Keep domain framing, clarification, source/evidence synthesis, draft outputs, and next-work routing in Hermes. A prepared brief, review, reply, or plan is not an external action, approval, filing, send, publish, data mutation, implementation, review, CI, or merge claim. Prepare a connector, file, coding, or human-review handoff only when the user explicitly accepts that next step; report it only from observed evidence. Hermes prepares research, discovery, and message guidance; it does not research unobserved facts as facts, contact prospects, create opportunities, change CRM data, book meetings, or claim revenue or progress.

Required inputs:

- account or segment
- available evidence
- buyer hypothesis
- sales objective

Expert clarification questions:
- `account or segment`
  - English: Which fit criteria and disqualifiers, offer or use case, stage and owner, geography, and evidenced stakeholders and roles define the account or segment?
  - Korean: 어떤 적합 기준과 제외 기준, 제안 또는 사용 사례, 단계와 책임자, 지역, 근거가 있는 이해관계자와 역할이 계정 또는 세그먼트를 정의하나요?

Expected outputs:

- sales_opportunity_evidence_record/v1
- sales_qualification_state/v1
- sales_draft_sequence/v1
- sales_handoff_disposition/v1

Artifact expectations:

- prepared sales development brief when a wrapper captures it

Safety rules:

- Treat unsupported company and competitor information as evidence gaps, not facts.
- Do not claim prospect contact, CRM mutation, meeting booking, opportunity creation, revenue, or progress.

Procedure: load `references/procedure.md`.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `ops-review`.

```sh
Silvirica runtime record --skill sales-development --harness ops-review --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared Silvirica routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: its SOUL.md persona owns reply language, tone, speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included (where it sets no language, use the one the user wrote in), and Silvirica shapes structure and content only; Silvirica's record terms (surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn, offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.

Use Silvirica-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.
